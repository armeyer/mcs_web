\textbf{Reminder}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Problems should be
  \href{https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp14/6.042/courseMaterial/topics/topic2/syllabus/text3/text}
       {submitted electronically}, and each problem should begin with a \emph{Collaboration Statement}.
\iffalse

{\emph{collaboration statement}}
\fi

\item The class has a
  \href{http://piazza.com/mit/spring2014/6042j18062j/home} {Piazza
    forum}.  With Piazza you may post questions---both administrative
  and content related---to the entire class or to just the staff.  You
  are likely to get faster response through Piazza than from direct
  email to staff.

Posting a question or comment to Piazza is required during both the
first and second weeks of the class; after that Piazza use is
optional.
