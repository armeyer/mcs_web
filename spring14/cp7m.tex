%\pinput{TP_basic_relations}  depends on "equivalence relation," which is part of the next class day
%\pinput{CP_partially_ordered_by_divisibility}
%\pinput{CP_equiv_partition_proof}  also depends on "equivalence relation"
%\pinput{CP_equivalence_same_property}  also depends on "equivalence relation"
%\pinput{CP_binary_relations_on_01}  uses relational properties that go with the next class day
