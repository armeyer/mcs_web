\textbf{Reminder}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Problems should be
  \href{https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp14/6.042/courseMaterial/topics/topic2/syllabus/text3/text}
       {submitted electronically}, and each problem should begin with a \emph{Collaboration Statement}.
\iffalse
\href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring14/submission.shtml#collab-state}
{\emph{collaboration statement}}
\fi

\item The class has a
  \href{http://piazza.com/mit/spring2014/6042j18062j/home} {Piazza
    forum}.  With Piazza you may post questions---both administrative
  and content related---to the entire class or to just the staff.  You
  are likely to get faster response through Piazza than from direct
  email to staff.

Students are require to post a question or comment on Piazza once before lecture on Friday, 
February 14; after that Piazza use is optional.
