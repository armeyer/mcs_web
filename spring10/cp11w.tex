\centerline{\textbf{Combinatorial proofs of identities}}
Recall the basic plan for a combinatorial proof of an identity $x=y$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define a set $S$.
\item Show that $\card{S} = x$ by counting one way.
\item Show that $\card{S} = y$ by counting another way.
\item Conclude that $x = y$.
\end{enumerate}
