\section*{Appendix}

Let $[x^n]F(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in the power series
for $F(x)$.  Then,
\begin{equation}\label{1axk}
[x^n]\paren{\frac{1}{\paren{1-\alpha x}^k}} = \binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\alpha^n.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Partial Fractions}

Here's a particular case of the Partial Fraction Rule that should be
enough to illustrate the general Rule.  Let
\[
r(x) \eqdef \frac{p(x)}{(1-\alpha x)^2 (1-\beta x) (1-\gamma x)^3}
\]
where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are distinct complex numbers, and $p(x)$ is
a polynomial of degree less than the demoninator, namely, less than 6.
Then there are unique numbers $a_1,a_2,b,c_1,c_2,c_3 \in \complexes$ such
that
\[
r(x)
= \frac{a_1}{1-\alpha x} + \frac{a_2}{(1-\alpha x)^2}
+ \frac{b}{1-\beta x}
+ \frac{c_1}{1-\gamma x} + \frac{c_2}{(1-\gamma x)^2} + \frac{c_3}{(1-\gamma x)^3}
\]

\iffalse
Partial fractions together with~\eqref{1axk} imply that there is a closed
form expression for $[x^n]\paren{R(x)/S(x)}$ for arbitrary polynomials
$R(x),S(x)$.
