\chapter{Infinite Cardinality, Number Theory I-II (GCD, Modular Arithmetic}


%% Siggi's Original Problems
\begin{enumerate}

\item If $A_n$ is countable for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ prove that $$\cup_{n \in\mathbb{N}}A_n$$ is countable.

\item Prove that $pow(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable.

\item Prove that the subset of a countable set is countable.

\item Sean wants to collect all pythagorean triples in a set. Show that this set is countable. (A pythagorean triple $(a,b,c) \in \mathbb{Z}^3$ is such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$).

\item Show that if $A$ is an infinite set and $C$ is countable then $A bij A\cup C$.

\item If $a=b \mod m$ and $d|m$, $d>0$ then $a=b \mod d$. 

\item Use CRT to find consecutive integers $a,b, (a+1=b)$ such that $4|b$ and $9|a$.

\item Prove that the $gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b)=a*b$. Does this hold for three integers, i.e. $gcd(a,b,c)*lcm(a,b,c)=abc$?

\item Show that if $p$ is prime then ${p-1 \choose k}=(-1)^k (mod p)$ for $0\leq k \leq p-1$.

\item Show that if $p$ is prime then ${p \choose k}=0 (mod p)$ for $1\leq k \leq p-1$

\item In 1874 Iceland got its first constitution but what is $3^{1874} (\mod 6042)$?

\item What is the remainder of $2^{100}+3^{100}+4^{100}+5^{100}$ when divided by 7?

\item If $p$ is prime, prove that $(p-1)! = -1 (\mod p)$. [HINT: Think about inverses] (If this is too hard, they may take for granted that if $a = a^{-1} (\mod p)$ then $a = \pm 1 (\mod p)$.)

\item Prove that If $(p-1)! = -1 (mod p)$ then $p$ is prime.
