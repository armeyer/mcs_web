Conditional Probability, Ch. 17

Most teams finished 20 or more minutes early, mainly because staff was
not adequately briefed to get discussions going as directed in
individual problems.  Also, PS_conditional_probability_problem_errors
had been added as a fifth problem but did not make it into the actual
handout used in class.
