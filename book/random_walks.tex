\chapter{Random Walks}\label{ran_process_chap}

\term{Random Walks} are used to model situations in which an object
moves in a sequence of steps in randomly chosen directions.  Many
phenomena can be modeled as a random walk and we will see several
examples in this chapter.  Among other things, we'll see why it is
rare that you leave the casino with more money than you entered with
and we'll see how the Google search engine uses random walks through
the graph of the world-wide web links to determine the relative
importance of websites.

\section{Unbiased Random Walks}

\subsection{A Bug's Life}

There is a small flea named Stencil.  To his right, there is an
endless flat plateau.  One inch to his left is the Cliff of Doom,
which drops to a raging sea filled with flea-eating monsters.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{stencil1}
\end{figure}

Each second, Stencil hops 1 inch to the right or 1 inch to the left
with equal probability, independent of the direction of all previous
hops.  If he ever lands on the very edge of the cliff, then he teeters
over and falls into the sea.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{stencil2}
\end{figure}
%
So, for example, if Stencil's first hop is to the left, he's fishbait.
On the other hand, if his first few hops are to the right, then he may
bounce around happily on the plateau for quite some time.

Our job is to analyze the life of Stencil.  Does he have any chance of
avoiding a fatal plunge?  If not, how long will he hop around before
he takes the plunge?

Stencil's movement is an example of a \term{random walk}.  A typical
\term{one-dimensional} random walk involves some value that randomly
wavers up and down over time.  The walk is said to be \term{unbiased}
if the value is equally likely to move up or down.  If the walk ends
when a certain value is reached, then that value is called a
\term{boundary condition} or \term{absorbing barrier}.  For example,
the Cliff of Doom is a boundary condition in the example above.

Many natural phenomena are nicely modeled by random walks.  However,
for some reason, they are traditionally discussed in the context of
some social vice.  For example, the value is often regarded as the
position of a drunkard who randomly staggers left, staggers right, or
just wobbles in place during each time step.  Or the value is the
wealth of a gambler who is continually winning and losing bets.  So
discussing random walks in terms of fleas is actually sort of
elevating the discourse.

\subsection{A Simpler Problem}

Let's begin with a simpler problem.  Suppose that Stencil is on a
small island; now, not only is the Cliff of Doom 1 inch to his left,
but also there is another boundary condition, the Pit of Disaster,
2~inches to his right!  For example, see Figure~\ref{fig:19P1}

\begin{figure}

\gnote{Geoff: Note corrections: Figure P1, p. 3 (P-3), ch19-ftl-jul27.pdf}

\graphic{stencil3}

\caption{An unbiased, one-dimensional random walk with absorbing
  barriers at positions 0 and~3.  The walk begins at position~1.  The
  tree diagram shows the probabilities of hitting each barrier.}

\label{fig:19P1}

\end{figure}

In the figure, we've worked out a tree diagram for Stencil's possible
fates.  In particular, he falls off the Cliff of Doom on the left side
with probability:
%
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} + \ldots
    & = \frac{1}{2} \paren{1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} + \ldots} \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - 1/4} \\
    & = \frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*}
%
Similarly, he falls into the Pit of Disaster on the right side with
probability:
%
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{64} + \ldots = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
%
There is a remaining possibility: Stencil \emph{could} hop back and
forth in the middle of the island forever.  However, we've already
identified two disjoint events with probabilities $2/3$ and $1/3$, so
this happy alternative must have probability~0.

\subsection{A Big Island}\label{sec:flea_analysis}

Putting Stencil on such a tiny island was sort of cruel.  Sure, he's
probably carrying bubonic plague, but there's no reason to pick on the
little fella.  So suppose that we instead place him $n$ inches from
the left side of an island $w$ inches across:
%
\begin{figure}[h]

\gnote{Geoff: Change right text to ``Pits of Disaster''.}

\graphic{stencil4}
\end{figure}
%
In other words, Stencil starts at position~$n$ and his random walk
ends if he ever reaches positions 0 or~$w$.

Now he has three possible fates: he could fall off the Cliff of Doom,
fall into the Pit of Disaster, or hop around on the island forever.
We could compute the probabilities of these three events with a
horrific summation, but fortunately there's a far easier method: we
can use a linear recurrence.

Let $R_n$ be the probability that Stencil falls to the right into the
Pit of Disaster, given that he starts at position~$n$.  In a couple
special cases, the value of $R_n$ is easy to determine.  If he starts
at position~$w$, he falls into the Pit of Disaster immediately, so
$R_w = 1$.  On the other hand, if he starts at position $0$, then he
falls from the Cliff of Doom immediately, so $R_0 = 0$.

Now suppose that our frolicking friend starts somewhere in the middle
of the island; that is, $0 < n < w$.  Then we can break the analysis
of his fate into two cases based on the direction of his first hop:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item

If his first hop is to the left, then he lands at position $n-1$ and
eventually falls into the Pit of Disaster with probability~$R_{n-1}$.

\item

On the other hand, if his first hop is to the right, then he lands at
position~$n+1$ and eventually falls into the Pit of Disaster with
probability~$R_{n+1}$.

\end{itemize}
%
Therefore, by the Total Probability Theorem, we have:
%
\[
R_n = \frac{1}{2} R_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} R_{n+1}.
\]

\subsubsection{Solving the Recurrence}

Let's assemble all our observations about $R_n$, the probability that
Stencil falls into the Pit of Disaster if he starts at position~$n$:
%
\begin{align*}
R_0 & = 1 \\
R_w & = 0 \\
R_n & = \frac{1}{2} R_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} R_{n+1} \qquad (0 < n < w).
\end{align*}
%
This is just a linear recurrence---and we know how to solve those!
Uh, right?  Remember Chapter~\ref{chap:recurrences} or
Chapter~\ref{generating_function_chap}?

There is one unusual complication: in a normal recurrence, $R_n$~is
written a function of preceding terms.  In this recurrence equation,
however, $R_n$~is a function of both a preceding term~($R_{n-1}$) and
a \emph{following} term~($R_{n+1}$).  This is no big deal, however,
since we can just rearrange the terms in the recurrence equation:
%
\[
    R_{n+1} = 2 R_n - R_{n-1}.
\]
%
Now we're back on familiar territory.

Let's solve the recurrence.  The characteristic equation is:
%
\[
    x^2 - 2 x + 1 = 0.
\]
%
This equation has a double root at~$x = 1$.  There is no inhomogeneous
part, so the general solution has the form:
%
\[
    R_n = a \cdot 1^n + b \cdot n 1^n = a + b n.
\]
%
Substituting in the boundary conditions $R_0 = 0$ and $R_w = 1$ gives
two linear equations:
%
\begin{align*}
0 & = a, \\
1 & = a + b w.
\end{align*}
%
The solution to this system is $a = 0$, $b = 1 / w$.  Therefore, the
solution to the recurrence is:
%
\[
    R_n = n / w.
\]

\subsection{Death Is Certain}

Our analysis shows that if we place Stencil $n$ inches from the left
side of an island $w$ inches across, then he falls off the right side
with probability $n / w$.  For example, if Stencil is $n = 4$ inches
from the left side of an island $w = 12$ inches across, then he falls
off the right side with probability $n / w = 4 / 12 = 1 / 3$.

We can compute the probability that he falls off the \emph{left} side
by exploiting the symmetry of the problem: the probability that he
falls off the \emph{left} side starting at position $n$ is the same as
the probability that he falls of the \emph{right} side starting at
position $w - n$, which is $(w - n) / n$.

This is bad news.  The probability that Stencil eventually falls off
one side or the other is:
%
\[
    \frac{n}{w} + \frac{w - n}{w} = 1.
\]
%
There's no hope!  The probability that Stencil hops around on the
island forever is zero.

And there's even worse news.  Let's go back to the original problem
where Stencil is 1 inch from the left edge of an \emph{infinite}
plateau.  In this case, the probability that he eventually falls into
the sea is:
%
\[
    \lim_{w \to \infty} \frac{w - 1}{w} = 1.
\]
So even if there were no Pit of Disaster, Stencil still falls off the
Cliff of Doom with probability~1.  And since
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{w \to \infty} \frac{w - n }{w} = 1
\end{equation*}
for any finite~$n$, this is true no matter where Stencil starts.  Our
little friend is doomed!

Hey, you know how in the movies they often make it look like the hero
dies, but then he comes back in the end and everything turns out okay?
Well, we're not sayin' anything, just pointing that out.

\subsection{Life Expectancy}\label{sec:life_expectancy}

On the bright side, Stencil may get to hop around for a while before
he goes over an edge.  Let's use the same setup as before, where he
starts out $n$~inches from the left side of an island $w$~inches
across:
%
\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic{stencil4}
\end{figure}
%
What is the expected number of hops he takes before falling off an
edge?

Let $X_n$~be Stencil's expected lifespan, measured in hops.  If he
starts at either edge of the island, then he dies immediately:
%
\begin{align*}
X_0 & = 0, \\
X_w & = 0.
\end{align*}
%
If he starts somewhere in the middle of the island ($0 < n < w$), then
we can again break down the analysis into two cases based on his first
hop:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item

If his first hop is to the left, then he lands at position $n-1$ and
can expect to live for another $X_{n-1}$ steps.

\item

If his first hop is to the right, then he lands at position $n+1$ and
can expect to live for another $X_{n+1}$~steps.

\end{itemize}
%
Thus, by the Law of Total Expectation and Linearity of Expectation,
Stencil's expected lifespan is:
%
\begin{align*}
    X_n & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} X_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} X_{n+1}.
\end{align*}
%
The leading~$1$ accounts for his first hop.

\subsubsection{Solving the Recurrence}

Once again, Stencil's fate hinges on a recurrence equation:
%
\[
\begin{array}{rl}
X_0 & = 0 \\
X_w & = 0 \\
X_n & = 1 + \frac{1}{2} X_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} X_{n+1} \qquad (0 < n < w).
\end{array}
\]
%
We can rewrite the last line as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:19P1}
    X_{n+1} = 2 X_n - X_{n-1} - 2.
\end{equation}
%
As before, the characteristic equation is:
%
\[
    x^2 - 2 x + 1 = 0.
\]
%
There is a double-root at~1, so the homogeneous solution has the form:
%
\[
    X_n = a + b n.
\]
%
But this time, there's an inhomogeneous term, so we also need to find a
particular solution.  Since this term is a constant, we should try a
particular solution of the form $X_n = c$ and then try $X_n = c + d n$
and then $X_n = c + d n + e n^2$ and so forth.  As it turns out, the
first two possibilities don't work, but the third does.  Substituting
$X_n = c + d n + e n^2$ into Equation~\ref{eqn:19P1} gives
%
\begin{equation*}
c + d(n+1) + e(n+1)^2 = 2 (c + dn + en^2)
    - \paren{c + d(n-1) + e(n-1)^2} - 2,
\end{equation*}
which simplifies to~$e = -1$.  Since all the $c$ and $d$~terms cancel,
$X_n = c + d n - n^2$ is a particular solution for all $c$ and~$d$.
For simplicity, let's take $c = d = 0$.  Thus, our particular solution
is $X_n = - n^2$.

Adding the homogeneous and particular solutions gives the general form
of the solution:
%
\begin{align*}
    X_n & = a + b n - n^2.
\end{align*}
%
Substituting in the boundary conditions $X_0 = 0$ and $X_w = 0$ gives
two linear equations:
%
\begin{align*}
0 & = a, \\
0 & = a + b w - w^2.
\end{align*}
%
The solution to this system is $a = 0$ and $b = w$.  Therefore, the
solution to the recurrence equation is:
%
\[
X_n = w n - n^2 = n (w - n).
\]

\subsubsection{Interpreting the Solution}

Stencil's expected lifespan is $X_n = n (w - n)$, which is the
\emph{product} of the distances to the two edges.  Thus, for example,
if he's 4~inches from the left edge and 8~inches from the right cliff,
then his expected lifespan is $4 \cdot 8 = 32$.

Let's return to the original problem where Stencil has the Cliff of
Doom 1 inch to his left and an infinite plateau to this right.  (Also,
cue the ``hero returns'' theme music.)  In this case, his expected
lifespan is:
%
\[
\lim_{w \to \infty} 1 (w - 1) = \infty
\]
%
\emph{Yes, Stencil is certain to eventually fall off the Cliff of
  Doom---but his expected lifespan is infinite!}  This sounds almost
like a contradiction, but both answers are correct!

Here's an informal explanation.  It turns out that the
probability~$p_k$ that Stencil falls from the Cliff of Doom on the
$k$th step is~$\Theta(1/k^{3/2})$.  You can verify by the integration
bound that $\sum_{i = 1}^\infty 1/k^{3/2}$ converges.

On the other hand, the expected time until Stencil falls over the edge
is
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 1}^\infty k p_k
    &\ge c \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{k}{k^{3/2}} \\
    &=   c \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \\
    &=   \infty,
\end{align*}
where $c$~is a constant that comes from the $\Theta$~notation.  So our
answers are compatible.

\subsection{Application to Fair Gambling Games}

We took the high road for a while, but let's now discuss random walks
in a more conventional setting---gambling.

A gambler goes to Las Vegas with~\$$n$ in her pocket.  Her plan is to
make only \$1~bets and somehow she has found a casino that will offer
her truly even odds\footnote{Don't worry, we'll get to the more
  realistic scenario when she is more likely to lose than win in a
  moment, but let's just fantasize about the fair scenario for a
  bit.}; namely, she will win or lose~\$1 on each bet with
probability~$1/2$. She'll play until she is broke or she has
won~\$$m$.  In the latter case, she will go home with
\begin{equation*}
    w = n + m
\end{equation*}
dollars. What's the probability that she goes home a winner?

This is identical to the flea problem that we just analyzed.  Going
broke is analogous to falling off the Cliff of Doom.  Going home a
winner is analogous to falling into the Pit of Disaster, just a lot
more fun.

Our analysis of Stencil's life tells us everything we want to know
about the gambler's prospects:
\begin{itemize}

\item

The gambler goes home broke with probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{n}{w} = \frac{m}{n + m},
\end{equation*}

\item

the gambler goes home a winner with probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{w - n}{w} = \frac{n}{n + m},
\end{equation*}

\item

the gambler goes home with probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{n}{n + m} + \frac{m}{n + m} = 1,
\end{equation*}

\item

and the number of bets before the gambler goes home is expected to be
\begin{equation*}
    n (w - n) = nm.
\end{equation*}

\end{itemize}

If the gambler gets greedy and keeps playing until she goes broke,
then
\begin{itemize}

\item

the gambler eventually goes broke with probability~1, and

\item
the number of bets before the gambler goes broke is expected to be
infinite.

\end{itemize}

The bottom line here is clear: when gambling, quit while you are
ahead---if you play until you go broke, you will certainly go broke.

And that's the good news!  Matters get much worse for the more typical
scenario where the odds are against you.  Let's see why.

\section{Gambler's Ruin}

So far, we have considered \emph{unbiased} random walks, where the
probability of moving up or down (or left or right) is~$1/2$.
Unfortunately, things are never quite this simple (or fair) in real
casinos.

For example, suppose the gambler goes to Las Vegas and makes \$1~bets
on red or black in roulette.  In this case, she will win~\$1 with
probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{18}{38} \approx 0.473
\end{equation*}
and she will lose~\$1 with probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{20}{38} \approx 0.527.
\end{equation*}
That's because the casinos add those bothersome green 0 and~00 to give
the house a slight advantage.

At first glance (or after a few drinks), $18/38$ seems awfully close
to~$1/2$ and so our intuition tells us that the game is ``almost
fair.''  So we might expect the analysis we just did for the fair game
to be ``almost right'' for the real game.  For example, if the gambler
starts with~\$100 and quits when she gets ahead by~\$100 in the fair
game, then she goes home a winner with probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{100}{200} = .5.
\end{equation*}
And, if she wants to improve her chances of going home a winner, she
could bring more money.  If she brings~\$1000 and quits when she gets
ahead by~\$100 in the fair game, then she goes home a winner with
probability
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1000}{1100} \approx .91.
\end{equation*}

So, given that the real game is ``almost fair,'' we might expect the
probabilities of going home a winner in these two scenarios to be
``almost 50\% and~91\%,'' respectively.

Unfortunately for the gambler, all this ``almost'' reasoning will
almost surely lead to disaster.  Here are the grim facts for the real
game where the gambler wins~\$1 with probability~$18/38$.
\[
\begin{array}{c@{\qquad}c}
\text{$n =$ starting wealth} &
\text{probability she reaches $n + \$100$ before \$0} \\[0.5ex]
\$100 & \text{1 in 3764\underline{9}.619496\ldots} \\[0.5ex]
\$1000 & \text{1 in 37648.619496\ldots} \\[0.5ex]
\$1,000,000,000 & \text{1 in 37648.619496\ldots}
\end{array}
\]
%
Except on the very low end, the amount of money she brings makes
almost no difference!\footnote{The fact that only one digit changes
  from the first case to the second is a peripheral bit of bizarreness
  that we'll leave in your hands.} She is almost certain to go broke
before winning~\$100.  Let's see why.

\subsection{Finding a Recurrence}

We can approach the gambling problem the same way we studied the life
of Stencil.  Suppose that the gambler starts with $n$ dollars.  She
wins each bet with probability $p$ and plays until she either goes
bankrupt or has~$w = n + m$ dollars in her pocket.  (To be clear, $w$
is the total amount of money she wants to end up with, not the amount
by which she wants to increase her wealth, which is~$m$.)  Our
objective is to compute $R_n$, the probability that she goes home a
winner.

As usual, we begin by identifying some boundary conditions.  If she
starts with no money, then she's bankrupt immediately so $R_0 = 0$.
On the other hand, if she starts with $w$ dollars, then she's an
instant winner, so $R_w = 1$.

Now we divide the analysis of the general situation into two cases
based on the outcome of her first bet:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item She wins her first bet with probability $p$.  She then has $n +
1$ dollars and probability $R_{n+1}$ of reaching her goal of $w$
dollars.

\item She loses her first bet with probability $1-p$.  This leaves her
with $n - 1$ dollars and probability $R_{n-1}$ of reaching her goal.

\end{itemize}
%
Plugging these facts into the Total Probability Theorem gives the
equation:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:19P3}
    R_n = p R_{n+1} + (1 - p) R_{n-1}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Solving the Recurrence}

Rearranging the terms in Equation~\ref{eqn:19P3} gives us a recurrence
for $R_n$, the probability that the gambler reaches her goal of $w$
dollars if she starts with $n$:
%
\begin{align*}
R_0 & = 0 \\
R_w & = 1 \\
p R_{n + 1} - R_n + (1 - p) R_{n - 1} &= 0
& (0 < n < w).
\end{align*}
%
The characteristic equation is:
%
\[
    p x^2 - x + (1-p) = 0.
\]
%
The quadratic formula gives the roots:
%
\begin{align*}
x & = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4 p (1-p)}}{2p} \\
  & = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(1-2p)^2}}{2p} \\
  & = \frac{1 \pm (1-2p)}{2p} \\
  & = \frac{1-p}{p} \text{ or } 1.
\end{align*}

There's an important point lurking here.  If the gambler is equally
likely to win or lose each bet, then $p = 1/2$, and the characteristic
equation has a double root at $x = 1$.  This is the situation we
considered in the flea problem.  The double root led to a general
solution of the form:
%
\[
R_n = a + b n
\]
%
Now suppose that the gambler is \emph{not} equally likely to win or
lose each bet; that is, $p \neq 1/2$.  Then the two roots of the
characteristic equation are different, which means that the solution
has a completely different form:
%
\[
R_n = a \cdot \paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^n + b \cdot 1^n
\]
%
In mathematical terms, this is where the fair game and the ``almost
fair'' game take off in completely different directions: in one case
we get a linear solution and in the other we get an exponential
solution!  This is going to be bad news for anyone playing the
``almost fair'' game.

Anyway, substituting the boundary conditions into the general form of
the solution gives a system of linear equations:
%
\begin{align*}
0 & = a + b \\
1 & = a \cdot \paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w + b.
\end{align*}
%
Solving this system, gives:
%
\begin{align*}
a & = \frac{1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1}, &
b & = - \frac{1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1}. &
\end{align*}
%
Substituting these values back into the general solution gives:
%
\begin{align*}
R_n
    & = \paren{\frac{1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1}} \cdot
        \paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^n - \frac{1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1} \\
    & = \frac{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^n-1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1}.
\end{align*}
%
(Suddenly, Stencil's life doesn't seem so bad, huh?)

\subsection{Bad News!}

We have an answer!  But it's not good news. If the gambler starts with
$n$ dollars and wins each bet with probability $p$, then the
probability she reaches $w$ dollars before going broke is:
%
\[
\frac{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^n-1}{\paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^w-1}.
\]

Let's try to make sense of this expression.  If the game is biased
against her, as with roulette, then $1-p$ (the probability she loses)
is greater than $p$ (the probability she wins).  If $n$, her starting
wealth, is also reasonably large, then both exponentiated fractions
are big numbers and the -1's don't make much difference.  Thus, her
probability of reaching $w$ dollars is very close to:
%
\[
    \paren{\frac{1-p}{p}}^{n-w} = \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^m.
\]
%
In particular, if she is hoping to come out~$m = \$100$ ahead in
roulette, then $p = 18/38$ and her probability of success is:
%
\[
    \paren{\frac{10}{9}}^{-100} = 1 \text{ in } 37648.619496.
\]
%
This explains the strange number we arrived at earlier!  In fact, this
number does not change no matter how large $n$~gets, so even if the
gambler starts with a trillion dollars, she is sill not likely to ever
get ahead by even~\$100.

\subsection{But Why?}

Why does the gambler's starting wealth have so little impact on her
probability of coming out ahead?  Intuitively, there are two forces at
work.  First, the gambler's wealth has random upward and downward
\emph{swings} due to runs of good and bad luck.  Second, her wealth
has a steady, downward \emph{drift} because she has a small expected
loss on every bet.  The situation is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:19P3}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]

\graphic{gambler}

\caption{In a biased random walk, the downward drift usually dominates
  swings of good luck.}

\label{fig:19P3}

\end{figure}

For example, in roulette, the gambler wins a dollar with
probability~$18/38$ and loses a dollar with probability~$20/38$.
Therefore, her expected return on each bet is
\begin{equation*}
1 \cdot \frac{18}{38} + (-1) \cdot \frac{20}{38}
    = \frac{-2}{38}
    = -\frac{1}{19}.
\end{equation*}
Thus, her expected wealth drifts downward by a little over 5~cents per
bet.

One might think that if the gambler starts with a billion dollars,
then she will play for a long time, so at some point she should have a
lucky, upward swing that puts her \$100 ahead.  The problem is that
her capital is steadily drifting downward.  And after her capital
drifts down a few hundred dollars, she needs a huge upward swing to
save herself.  And such a huge swing is extremely improbable.  So if
she does not have a lucky, upward swing early on, she's doomed
forever.  As a rule of thumb, \emph{drift} dominates \emph{swings}
over the long term.

\subsection{Expected Playing Time}

Even though casino gamblers are destined to lose, some of them enjoy
the process.  So let's figure out how long their enjoyment is expected
to last.

Let $X_n$~be the expected number of bets before going home (broke or a
winner).  Reasoning as in Section~\ref{sec:life_expectancy}, we can
set up a recurrence for~$X_n$:
\begin{align}
    X_0 &= 0, \notag\\
    X_w &= 0, \notag\\
    X_n &= 1 + (1 - p) X_{n - 1} + p X_{n + 1}. \label{eqn:19P5}
\end{align}
This is the same as the recurrence for~$R_n$ in
Equation~\ref{eqn:19P3} except for the inhomogeneous part.

To find the particular solution, we try $X_n = c$ (which doesn't work)
and then $X_n = c + d n$ (which does work as long as~$p \ne 1/2$).
Plugging $X_n = c + d n$ into Equation~\ref{eqn:19P5} yields:
\begin{align*}
c + d n
    &= 1 + (1 - p) (c + d (n - 1)) + p (c + d (n + 1)) \\
    &= 1 + c + d n - (1 - p) d + p d
\end{align*}
and thus that
\begin{equation*}
    d = \frac{1}{1 - 2p}.
\end{equation*}
Since $c$~is arbitrary, we will set~$c = 0$ and our particular
solution is
\begin{equation*}
    X_n = \frac{n}{1 - 2p}.
\end{equation*}

The characteristic equation for Equation~\ref{eqn:19P5} is
\begin{equation*}
    p x^2 - x + (1 - p) = 0.
\end{equation*}
We have already determined that the roots for this equation are
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1 - p}{p} \quad \text{and} \quad 1.
\end{equation*}

Hence, the general solution to the recurrence is
\begin{equation*}
    X_n = a \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^n + b + \frac{n}{1 - 2p}.
\end{equation*}
Plugging in the boundary conditions, we find that
\begin{align*}
    0 &= a + b, \\
    0 &= a \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w + b + \frac{w}{1 - 2p}.
\end{align*}
Hence
\begin{equation*}
a = \frac{\displaystyle - \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}}
         {\displaystyle \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
b = \frac{\displaystyle \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}}
         {\displaystyle \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}.
\end{equation*}
The final solution to the recurrence is then
\begin{align*}
X_n &= \frac{\displaystyle - \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}} \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^n }
           {\displaystyle \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}
 + \frac{\displaystyle \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}}
         {\displaystyle \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}
+ \frac{n}{1 - 2p} \\[2\jot]
    &= \frac{n}{1 - 2p} -
        \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}
        \left[
            \frac{\displaystyle\paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^n - 1}
                 {\displaystyle\paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}
        \right].
\end{align*}

Yikes!  The gambler won't have any fun at all if she is thinking about
this equation.  Let's see if we can make it simpler in the case
when~$m = w - n$ is large.

Since $p < 1/2$, \ $(1 - p)/p > 1$ and for large~$m$,
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{m \to \infty} \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}
    \left[
        \frac{\displaystyle\paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^n - 1}
             {\displaystyle\paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^w - 1}
    \right]
    = \lim_{m \to \infty} \paren{\frac{w}{1 - 2p}}
        \paren{\frac{1 - p}{p}}^{-m} = 0.
\end{equation*}
This means that as $m$~gets large,
\begin{equation*}
    X_n \sim \frac{n}{1 - 2p},
\end{equation*}
which is much simpler.  It says that if the gambler starts with~\$$n$,
she will expect to make about~$n/(1 - 2p)$ bets before she goes home
broke.  This seems to make sense since she expects to lose
\begin{equation*}
    1 \cdot (1 - p) + (-1) p = 1 - 2p
\end{equation*}
dollars on every bet and she started with $n$~dollars.\footnote{Be
  careful, it is tempting to use such a direct and simple argument
  instead of all those nasty recurrences, but such an argument is not
  correct.  There are examples where the expected duration of a
  process is not close to the starting point divided by the expected
  decrease at each step.}

\section{Walks Around a Circle}

So far, we have considered random walks on a line.  Now we'll look at
a problem where the random walk is on a circle.  Going from a line to
a circle may not seem like such a big change, but as we have seen so
often with probability, small changes can have large consequences that
are often beyond the grasp of our intuition.

\subsection{Pass the Broccoli}

Suppose there are $n + 1$~people, numbered~0, 1, \dots, $n$, sitting
in a circle as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:19P6}.  The B in
Figure~\ref{fig:19P6} indicates that person~0 has a big stalk of
nutritious broccoli, which provides 250\% of the US recommended daily
allowance of vitamin C and is also a good source of vitamin A and
iron.  (Typical for a random walk problem, this game originally
involved a pitcher of beer instead of a broccoli.  We're taking the
high road again.)

\end{picture}

\caption{$n + 1$ people sitting in a circle.  The B~indicates the
  person with the broccoli---in this case, person~0.}

\label{fig:19P6}

\end{figure}

Person 0 passes the broccoli either to the person on his left or the
person on his right with equal probability.  Then, that person also
passes the broccoli left or right at random and so on.  After a while,
everyone in an arc of the circle has touched the broccoli and everyone
outside that arc has not.  Eventually, the arc grows until all but one
person has touched the broccoli.  That final person is declared the
winner because they have avoided the brocolli for the longest time.

Suppose that you are allowed to position yourself anywhere in the
circle.  Where should you stand in order to maximize the probability
that you win?  You shouldn't be person 0; you can't win in that
position.  The answer is ``intuitively obvious'': you should sit as
far as possible from person~0, which would be position~$n / 2$ or $(n
+ 1)/2$ depending on whether $n$~is even or odd.

\subsection{There Is No Escape}

Let's try to verify this intuition.  Suppose that you sit at
position~$k \neq 0$.  At some point, the broccoli is going to end up
in the hands of one of your neighbors.  This has to happen eventually;
the game can't end until at least one of them touches it.  Let's say
that person $k - 1$ gets the broccoli first.  Now let's cut the circle
between yourself and your other neighbor, person $k+1$:
%
\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}
k & (k-1) & \ldots & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & n & (n-1) & \ldots & (k+1). \\
  & \mathbf{B} \\
\end{array}
\]
%
There are two possibilities.  If the broccoli reaches you before it
reaches person $k+1$, then you lose.  But if the broccoli reaches
person $k+1$ before it reaches you, then every other person has
touched the broccoli and you win.  So we need to compute the
probability that the broccoli hops $n - 1$~people to the right before
it takes 1~hop to the left.  This will be the probability that you
win.

But this is just the flea problem all over again.  From the analysis in
Section~\ref{sec:flea_analysis}, we know that the probability of moving
$n - 1$~steps rightward before moving one step leftward is
simply~$1/n$.  This means that wherever you sit (aside from
position~0, of course), your probability of getting the broccoli last
is~$1/n$.

So our intuition was completely wrong (again)!  It doesn't matter
where you sit.  Being close to the broccoli or far away at the start
makes no difference; there is no escape---you still get the broccoli
last with probability~$1/n$.

Enough with the bad news: Stencil's doomed, you go home broke from the
casino, and you can't escape the broccoli.  Let's see how to use
probability to \emph{make} some money.
