\begin{problem}
  Let $f:\nngint \to \reals$ be a real-valued total function.  A
  \emph{limit point} of $f$ is a real number $r\in\reals$ such that
  $f(n)$ is close to $r$ for \emph{infinitely many} $n$, where ``close
  to'' means within distance $\epsilon$ for whatever positive real
  number $\epsilon$ you may choose.

We can express the fact that $r$ is a limit point of $f$ with a logical
formula of the form:
\[
\mathbf{Q}_0\ \ \mathbf{Q}_1\ \ \mathbf{Q}_2.\ \abs{f(n)-r} \leq \epsilon,
\]
where $\mathbf{Q}_0, \mathbf{Q}_1, \mathbf{Q}_2$ is a sequence of
three quantifiers from among:
\[\begin{array}{cccc}
\forall n, & \exists n, & \forall n \geq n_0, & \exists n \geq n_0.\\
\forall n_0, & \exists n_0, & \forall n_0 \geq n, & \exists n_0 \geq n.\\
\forall \epsilon \geq 0, & \exists \epsilon \geq 0, & \forall \epsilon > 0, & \exists \epsilon >0.
\end{array}\]
Here the $n, n_0$ range over nonnegative integers, and $\epsilon$
ranges over real numbers.

Identify the proper quantifers:

$\mathbf{Q}_1$\hspace{0.4in} \examrule[0.7in]

$\mathbf{Q}_2$\hspace{0.4in} \examrule[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
Either  of the following:
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0\ \ \forall n_0\ \ \exists  n \geq n_0,
\]
or
\[
\forall n_0\ \ \forall \epsilon > 0\ \ \exists  n \geq n_0.
\]
\end{solution}
