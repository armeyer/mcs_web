\begin{problem}
The proof of the Handshaking Lemma~\bref{digraph-handshake} invoked
the ``obvious'' fact that in any finite digraph, the sum of the
in-degrees of the vertices equals the number of arrows in the graph.
That is,
\begin{claim*}
For any finite digraph, $G$,
\begin{equation}\label{indegree-count-arrows}
\sum_{v \in \vertices{G}} \indegr{v} = \card{\graph{G}},
\end{equation}
\end{claim*}
But this Claim might not be obvious to everyone.  So prove it by
induction on the number, $\card{\graph{G}}$, of arrows.
