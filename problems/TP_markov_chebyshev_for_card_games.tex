\begin{problem}
  \Albert\ has a gambling problem.  He plays 240 hands of draw poker, 120 hands
  of black jack, and 40 hands of stud poker per day.  He wins a hand of
  draw poker with probability 1/6, a hand of black jack with probability
  1/2, and a hand of stud poker with probability 1/5.  Let $W$ be the
  the number of hands that \Albert\ wins in a day.

  In your answers for this problem, you may finish with unevaluated numerical
  expressions if you like, assigning names to such quantities so that you
  may reference them later.

\ppart What is $\expect{W}$?

\exambox{1.0in}{0.4in}{0.0in}

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
The outcomes of the sample space are the $240+120+40= 400$ hands
played on a given day, with uniform probability.  For each hand $h$,
let $W_h$ be the indicator variable for \Albert\ winning hand $h$.  So
the number of hands won is
\[
W = \sum_h W_h.
\]

By linearity, the expectation of $W$ is the sum over the hands $h$
of the expectation of $W_h$.  But
\[
\expect{W_h} = \pr{\Albert\text{ won }h}.
\]
So
\[
\expect{W} = \sum_h \expect{h} = 240(1/6)+120(1/2)+40(1/5)=108.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart What would the Markov bound be on the probability that
\Albert\ will win at least 216 hands on a given day?

\exambox{0.5in}{0.4in}{0.0in}

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
The expected number of games won is 108, so
by Markov,
\[
\pr{W \geq 216} = \pr{W \geq 2\expect{W}} \leq  1/2.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Assume that the outcomes of the card games are \emph{pairwise}, but
possibly \emph{not mutually}, independent.  What is the variance of
the number of hands won per day?

\exambox{3.0in}{0.4in}{0.0in}

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
Pairwise independence is sufficient to ensure additivity of variance.
For an individual hand, the variance is $p(1-p)$, where $p$ is the
probability of winning.  Therefore, the variance of the total number
of hands won in a day is
\[
\variance{W} = 240 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} + 
120 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} +
40 \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5}
= \frac{1046}{15},
\]
which is $69\ \tfrac{11}{15}$.

\end{solution}

\ppart Use the Chebyshev bound to derive an upper bound on the
probability that \Albert\ will win at least 216 hands on a given day.

\exambox{2.0in}{0.4in}{0.0in}

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\pr{W \geq 216} = \pr{W - 108 \geq 108} \leq \pr{\abs{W -108} \geq 108} \leq
\frac{\variance{W}}{108^2} = \frac{1046}{15 \cdot (108)^2}, 
\]
which is approximately $0.006$.  So it's very unlikely that
\Albert\ will win 216 hands.
\end{solution}
