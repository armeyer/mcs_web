\begin{problem}

In the Mating Ritual, suppose Tiger is one of the boys and Elin is one of the girls.
Which of the following are preserved invariants \textbf{in general}?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.
\item On Tiger's current list, the girl whom he prefers to all the others is his optimal wife\footnote{His \term{optimal wife} in the usual sense: Given some particular instance of the Stable Marriage Problem, consider all 
possible stable perfect matchings, including that which is generated by the Mating Ritual.  In each of these, Tiger has a wife.  Of these ``possible wives,'' he finds one the most desirable.  This girl, to whom he is married in 
one of the matchings but not necessarily all of them, is his 
\term{optimal wife}.}.
\item Elin's name has been crossed off by Tiger and by everyone whom she prefers to him.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
The statements that are preserved invariants in general appear in boldface below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tiger is Elin's only suitor.  (This would certainly make Tiger Elin's favorite that day, but one or more of the boys who got rejected by another girl that day may visit Elin the following day.)
\item \textbf{On Tiger's current list, the girl whom he prefers to all the others is his optimal wife.}  (The Mating Ritual gives each boy his optimal wife.  Tiger must therefore ultimately marry his optimal wife, so once she 
becomes the most preferred girl on his list -- and thus the girl he is serenading -- she must remain the top girl on his list.)
\item \textbf{Elin's name has been crossed off by everyone whom she finds at least as desirable as Tiger.} (Note that this is a preserved invariant because it cannot ever be true.  Were it true on some day, Tiger would have 
crossed Elin's name off his list, so he would end up marrying a woman he finds less desirable.  She would also have removed from contention everyone she finds more desirable than Tiger.  So she would end up marrying someone she 
finds less desirable than Tiger.  Consequently, Tiger and Elin would constitute would a rogue couple.  Another way to think about it is this: If Elin's name was 
crossed off by Tiger and all the boys Elin prefers to him, then she must have a current favorite whom she prefers to all of them.  But Tiger and his betters in Elin's eyes are the top boys on her list: there is no one she 
prefers to them.)
