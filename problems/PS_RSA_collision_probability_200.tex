\begin{problem}
Suppose the RSA modulus $n=pq$ is the product of distinct $200$ digit
primes $p$ and $q$.  A message $m\in [0,n)$ is called \emph{dangerous} if
$\gcd(m,n)=p$ or $\gcd(m,n)=q$, because such an $m$ can be used to factor
$n$ and so crack RSA.

Estimate the fraction of messages in $[0,n)$ that are dangerous to the nearest order of magnitude.



\begin{solution}

Either $10^{-200}$ or $10^{-199}$ is acceptable.

For $m \in [0,pq)$,
\[
\gcd(m,pq)=p \qiff p \divides m.
\]

The fraction of numbers divisible by $p$ in an interval is $1/p$, 
and since $10^{199} \le p < 10^{200}$, $1/p$ is on the order of
$1/10^{200}$. The same logic holds for $q$.

Because $n = pq$,  none of the messages $m\in [0,n)$ can be divisible by
both $p$ and $q$, so the total fraction of dangerous messages is approximately
$1/p + 1/q$, which can be on the order of $10^{-200}$ or $10^{-199}$
depending on $p$ and $q$.

\end{solution}
