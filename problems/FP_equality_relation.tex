\begin{problem}
Let $A$ be a nonempty set.
\begin{problemparts}

\ppart\label{idwpoA} Describe a single relation on $A$ that is
\emph{both} an equivalence relation and a weak partial order on $A$.

\examrule[0.4in]

\begin{solution}
The equality relation, $\ident{A}$, on $A$ is obviously an
equivalence.  It is also \emph{vacuously} antisymmetric, since there
are no $a, b \in A$ such that
\[
a \neq b\ \QAND\ a \mrel{\ident{A}} b.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Prove that the relation of part~\eqref{idwpoA} is the only
relation on $A$ with these properties.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $R$ is a relation on $A$ that is an equivalence and a wpo.
Since $R$ is an equivalence, we know that $R$ is reflexive.  So to
show that $R = \ident{A}$, we need only show that
\[
a \mrel{R} b \QIMPLIES a = b.
\]

So suppose $a \mrel{R} b$.  Since $R$ is symmetric, we can conclude
that $b \mrel{R} a$.  Now since $R$ is antisymmetric, we conclude that
$a = b$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
