\begin{problem}
Let RSA public key $(e,n)$ and private key $(d,n)$
be generate by $300$ digit primes $p$ and $q$.
If a message $m$, where $0<m<n$, that happens to be a multiple of $p$ is found,
then RSA can be cracked by using $m$ and public key $(e,n)$ to reproduce
$p=gcd(n, m)$, $q=n/p$, $d=e^{-1} \pmod{(p-1)(q-1)}$.
What is the probability that a random message satifies this property?
Choose the closest:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{1}{300}$
\item $\frac{1}{600}$
\item $\frac{1}{300^{10}}$
\item $\frac{1}{600^{10}}$
\item $\frac{1}{10^{300}}$
\item $\frac{1}{10^{600}}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
The probability of a random integer is a multiple of $p$ is $\frac{1}{p}$.
Since $p$ is a 300 digit prime, $p$ is approximately $10^{300}$,
so the probability is $\frac{1}{10^{300}}$.
\end{solution}
