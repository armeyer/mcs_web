\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart The definition of $A \inj B$ is that there is a total injective relation 
from $A$ to $B$. Suppose the total condition was dropped, so that we have a
simpler definition $A \simpinj B$ iff there is an injective $[\leq 1\ \text{in}]$ 
relation from $A$ to $B$. Describe which sets $A$, $B$ are related by $\simpinj$. 
Explain.

\begin{solution}
$A \simpinj B$ is true for all sets $A$, $B$, because the empty relation 
(with no arrows) from $A$ to $B$ has $[\leq 1\ \text{in}]$, and is therefore
injective.
\end{soution}

\ppart Similarly, $A \surj B$ requires that there be a surjective function 
(not necessarily total) from $A$ to $B$. Suppose the function condition was
dropped, so we have a simpler definition $A \simpsurj B$ iff there is a 
surjective $[\geq 1\ \text{in}]$ relation from $A$ to $B$. Describe which sets
$A$, $B$ are related by $\simpsurj$. Explain.

\begin{solution}
If $A$ is nonempty, then $A \simpsurj B$ is true for all sets $B$, because there 
is an element $e$ in $A$, and the relation that has arrows from $e$ to every 
element of $B$ has $[\geq 1\ \text{in}]$ and is therefore surjective.

Also $\emptyset \simpsurj B$ is true iff $B = \emptyset$.
