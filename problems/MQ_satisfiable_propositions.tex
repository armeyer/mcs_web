\begin{problem}
For the following propositions, indicate whether they are valid
(\textbf{V}), satisfiable but not valid (\textbf{S}), or not
satisfiable (\textbf{N}).  For propositions marked \textbf{S}, give an
assignment of truth values that makes the proposition \True\ and an
assignment that makes it \False.

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}

\item S. $P: \false$; $P: \true$.

\item N, since $P \QAND (P \QIMP \bar{Q})$ means $Q$ must be False, but
  we also know it must be True.

\item V, since the left-hand side is always False

\item S. $P,Q:\true$ or $P:\false,Q:\text{[don't care]}$; $Q:\false, P:\true$

\item N, since the left hand side is always \True (because of $P \QOR
  \bar{P}$) but the right hand side must be \False.
