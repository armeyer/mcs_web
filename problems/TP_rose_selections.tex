\begin{problem}
How many different ways are there to select three dozen
colored roses if red, yellow, pink, white, purple and orange roses are
available?

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{36+5}{5} \, .
\]

There is a bijection from selections of three dozen roses to
bit-strings with three dozen 0's and five 1's (to delimit the 
numbers of roses of each of the six colors are chosen).
\end{solution}
