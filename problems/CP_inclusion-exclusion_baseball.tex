\begin{problem}
There are 180 games in the baseball season. A certain player's season
abides by the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item He rests (does not play) every 9th game ---beginning with game 9

\item He hits a home run every 4th game that he plays ---beginning with
  game 4

\item He strikes out every 5th game(if he is not resting) ---beginning
  with game 5

\item He cannot strike out and hit a home run in the same game
\end{itemize}

In how many games does the player either not hit a home run or not
strikeout (including days he is resting)?

\begin{solution}
We want the union of the sets: $A$ = games he rests, $B$ = games he
does not hit a home run, and $C$ = games he does not strike out.  By
the inclusion/exclusion principle:
\[
|A \union B \union C|  = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \intersect B| - |B \intersect C| - |A \intersect C| + |A \intersect B \intersect C|
                   = 20 + 135 + 144 - 20 ? 108 ? 20 + 20
                   = 171
\]
Because,
\[
|B \intersect C| = 180 - |\QNOT(B) \union \QNOT(C)| |\QNOT(B) \union \QNOT(C)| =
||\QNOT(B)| + |\QNOT(C)| - |\QNOT(B) \union \QNOT(C)| = 45 + 36 ? 9 = 72
|B \intersect C| = 108
\]

\end{solution}
\end{problem}
