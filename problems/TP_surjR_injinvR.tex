\begin{problem}

Prove that $\paren{A \surj B}$ implies $\paren{B \inj A}$.  It is
fine---even encouraged---to phrase things in terms of ``arrows-in''
and ``arrows-out.''

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
By definition of $\surj$, there is a $[\leq 1\ \text{out}], \geq
1\ \text{in}]$ surjective function, $R:A \to B$.  Reversing direction
  of the arrows, we have $\inv{R}: B \to A$ is a $[\geq 1\ \text{out},
    \leq 1\ \text{in}]$ total injective relation, so $B \inj A$ by
  definition of $\inj$.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
