\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart How many simple graphs are there with vertex set $\set{1,2,\dots,13}$?

\begin{solution}
There are $\binom{n}{2}$ potential edges, each of which may or
may not appear in a given graph.  Therefore, the number of graphs is:
\[
2^{\binom{n}{2}}
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart How many strict, linear partial orders with vertices
$\set{1,2,\dots,13}$ are there?

\begin
{solution}
\[
n!
\]

Since the partial order is linear, there is a unique listing of
the elements in decreasing partial order.  This listing defines a
bijection between the linear strict partial orders and the $n!$
permutations of $[1,n]$.
\end{solution}
