\begin{problem} Prove that $\log_{5} 10$ is irrational.
%\hint Proof by contradiction.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that
  \[
  \textcolor{red}{\log_{5} 10 = \frac{m}{n}}
  \]
  for some integers $m, n$ where $n>0$.  So we have
\begin{align}
  5^{\log_{5} 10} & = 5^{m/n}  & \text{(raising 5 to equal powers)},\notag\\
  10 & = 5^{m/n} & \text{(def of $\log_{5}$)},\notag\\
  10^n & = 5^m & \text{(raising both sides to the $n$th power)}.\notag\\
  (2\cdot 5)^n & = 5^m & \text{(factoring 10 into primes)}.\notag\\
  2^n\cdot 5^{n} & = 5^m. \label{2n2mfactoring}
\end{align}
By the uniqueness of prime factorization, the powers of primes on the
two sides of equation~\eqref{2n2mfactoring} must be equal. Since there
is no factor of 2 on the right hand side, $n$ must equal $0$ so that there
are no factors of 2 on the left side as well. This is a contradition. $\log_{5} 10$ is irrational.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
