\begin{problem} 
  \iffalse A binary relation, $R$, on a set, $A$, is
  \emph{irreflexive} iff $\QNOT(a \mrel{R} a)$ for all $a \in A$.  \fi
  Prove that if a binary relation on a set is transitive and
  irreflexive, then it is asymmetric.
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $R$ transitive and irreflexive.  To prove that it is
asymmetric, suppose $a\mrel{R}b$ holds for some $a,b\in A$.  We need
to prove $\QNOT(b \mrel{R} a)$.

So assume to the contrary that $b\mrel{R}a$ holds.  Then $a\mrel{R}b$
and $b\mrel{R}a$, so by transitivity, $a\mrel{R}a$, contradicting the
fact that $R$ is irreflexive.  So $b\mrel{R}a$ does not hold, as
claimed.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
