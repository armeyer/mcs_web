\begin{problem}
  Let $A$ be the following set of four propositional formulas shown below
  on the left, and let $C$ be the set of five propositional formulas oon
  the right.  A binary relation, $I$, from $A$ to $C$ is defined by the
  rule
\[
F \mrel{I} G \qiff [\text{the formula } (F \QIMPLIES G) \text{ is valid}].
\]
For example, $(P \QAND Q) \mrel{I} P$, because the formula $(P \QAND Q)$
does imply $P$.  Also, it is not true that $(P \QOR Q) \mrel{I} P$
since $(P \QOR Q) \QIMPLIES P$ is not valid.

  \bparts
  \ppart Fill in the arrows so the following figure describes the graph of
  the relation, $I$:

\[\begin{array}{lcr}
A & \hspace{1in} \text{arrows} \hspace{1in} & C\\
\hline
&\\
                                  && P\\
&\\
(P \QAND Q)\\
&\\
                                  && Q\\
&\\
(P \QOR Q)\\
&\\
                                  && (\bar{P} \QOR \bar{Q})\\
&\\
\QNOT(P \QAND Q)\\
&\\
                                  && (R \QOR \bar{R})\\
&\\                             
(P \QXOR Q)\\
&\\
                                  && (R \QAND \bar{R})
\end{array}\]

 \begin{solution}

 \ppart\label{Iprops} Circle the properties below possessed by the
 relation $I$:

  \mbox{~~TOTAL~~} &
  \mbox{~~INJECTIVE~~} &
  \mbox{~~SURJECTIVE~~} &
  \mbox{~~BIJECTIVE}

\begin{solution}
  TBA

  \ppart  Circle the properties below possessed by the relation $\inv{I}$:
  \[
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
  \mbox{FUNCTION~~} & 
  \mbox{~~TOTAL~~} &
  \mbox{~~INJECTIVE~~} &
  \mbox{~~SURJECTIVE~~} &

%THERE is a good problem idea here, but what's written is garbled
%and needs work.

Here are some two groups of expressions involving images and inverse
images under the relation $I$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
${P,Q}I$

\begin{solution}
$\set{(R \QOR \bar{R})}$.

${P,Q}I$ is by definition equal to the expressions in $C$ that are either
implied by $P$ or implied by $Q$.  The only expression in $C$ implied by
$P$ is the valid expression $(R \QOR \bar{R})$; this is also the only
expression in $C$ implied by $Q$.
\end{solution}

\item $\set{(P \QOR Q)}I \intersect \set{\QNOT(P\ \QAND\ Q)}I$

\begin{solution}
\[\begin{array}{l}
(P \XOR Q)I\\
\set{(\bar{P} \QOR \bar{Q}), (R \QOR \bar{R})}
\end{array}\]

These are the expressions in $C$ implied by both $(P \QOR Q)$ and also by
$\QNOT(P\ \QAND\ Q)$, which is the same as being implied by $P \XOR Q$.

\end{solution}

\item \set{(P \QAND Q),\QNOT(P\ \QAND\ Q)}I

\begin{solution}
These are the expressions in $C$ implied by the formula $(P \QAND Q)$ or by
$\QNOT(P \QAND Q)$

\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\iffalse

\ppart If we change the codomain $C$ to include $\bar{P}$, does your
answer to part~eqref{Iprops} change?  Explain your answer.
