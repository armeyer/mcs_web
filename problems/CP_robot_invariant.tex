\begin{problem}
A robot moves on the two-dimensional integer grid.  It starts out at
$(0,0)$, and is allowed to move in any of these four ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(+2,-1)$: right 2, down 1
\item $(-2,+1)$: left 2, up 1
\item $(+1,+3)$
\item $(-1,-3)$
\end{enumerate}

Prove that this robot can never reach $(1,1)$.
\begin{solution}

A simple preserved invariant that does the job is defined on
  states $(i,j)$ by the predicate: $i + 2j$ is an integer multiple of $7$.
\end{solution}
