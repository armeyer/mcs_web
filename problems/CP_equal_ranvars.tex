\begin{problem}
Let $R$ and $S$ be independent random variables on the same
probability space with the same finite range, $V$.
Suppose $R$ is uniform---that is,
\[
\pr{R=v} = \frac{1}{\card{V}},
\]
for all $v \in V$.  Then
\begin{quote}
the probability that $R=S$ is the same as the probability that $R$
takes whatever value $S$ happens to have and therefore
\begin{equation}\label{RS1V_CP}
\pr{R=S} = \frac{1}{\card{V}}\,.
\end{equation}
\end{quote}

The argument above is actually OK, but may seem too informal to be
completely convincing.  Give a careful proof of this claim.

\hint Use Total Probability on $\prcond{R=S}{S=v}$.

\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
\begin{staffnotes}
If students get stuck, give the first line as a hint.  If need be add
hint that 
\[
[R=S] \intersect [S=v] = [R=v] \intersect [S=v].
\]

\end{staffnotes}
\begin{align*}
\pr{R=S}
   & = \sum_{v \in V} \prcond{R=S}{S=v}\cdot \prob{S=v}
         & \text{(Total Probility)}\\
   & = \sum_{v \in V} \prcond{R=v}{S=v} \cdot \pr{S=v}
          & ([R=S \QAND S=v] = [R=v \QAND S=v])\\
   & = \sum_{v \in V} \pr{R=v} \cdot \pr{S=v}
          & \text{(independence of $R$ and $S$)}\\
   & = \sum_{v \in V} \frac{1}{\card{V}} \cdot \pr{S=v}
         &\text{($R$ is uniform)}\\
   & = \frac{1}{\card{V}} \cdot \sum_{v \in V} \pr{S=v}\\
   & = \frac{1}{\card{V}} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{\card{V}}.
\end{align*}
This proves~\eqref{RS1V_CP}.
\end{proof}

\end{solution}
