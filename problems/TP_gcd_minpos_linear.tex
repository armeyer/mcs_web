\begin{problem}
Prove that $\gcd(m,n)$ is the \emph{smallest positive} integer linear
combination of integers $m$ and $n$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
We know that $\gcd(m,n)$ is an integer linear combination of $m$ and
$n$ by Theorem~\bref{gcd_is_lin_thm}, and it must be positive by
definition.  Also, $\gcd(m,n)$ divides any integer linear combination
of $m$ and $n$ by Lemma~\bref{lem:div}.\bref{lem:divsbtc}, and so is
$\leq$ any positive integer linear combination of $m$ and $n$.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}
