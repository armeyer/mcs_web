\begin{problem}
Prove by the \emph{Well Ordering Principle}\footnote{Proofs by other
  methods such as induction or by appeal to known formulas for similar
  sums will not receive credit.} that for all positive integers, $n$:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-1) = n^2.
\]

\begin{solution}

The proof is by contradiction.

Suppose to the contrary that this failed for some $n
> 0$.  Then by the WOP, there is a \emph{smallest} nonnegative integer,
$m$, such this formula does not hold when $n = m$.

But it clearly holds when $n = 1$, which means that $m >
1$.  So $m-1$ is positive, and since it is smaller than $m$,
the formula must be true for $n = m-1$.  That is,
\begin{equation}\label{sum-to-m-1}
\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} (2i-1)  = (m-1)^2.
\end{equation}
Now add $2m+1$ to both sides of equation~\eqref{sum-to-m-1}.
Then the left hand side equals
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{m} (2i-1)
\]
and the right hand side equals
\[
(m-1)^2 + 2m - 1
\]
Now a little algebra %(given below) 
shows that the right hand side equals
\[
m^2 - 2m + 1 + 2m - 1 = m^2
\]
That is,
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{m} (2i-1) = m^2,
\]
contradicting the fact that our formula does not hold for
$m$.

\end{solution}
