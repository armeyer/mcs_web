\begin{problem}
Find the remainder of $26^{1818181}$ divided by $297$.
\hint{$1818181= (180 \cdot 10101) + 1$; \idx{Euler's theorem}}

\begin{solution} 26.

Since $26=2 \cdot 13$ and $297=3^3 \cdot 11$ are relatively prime,
Euler's theorem implies that
\[
k^{\phi(297)} \equiv 1 \pmod{297}
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\phi(297) & = \phi(3^3 \cdot 11) &\\
          & = \phi(3^3) \cdot \phi(11)   & \text{(since $\gcd(3^3,11)=1$)}\\
          & = (3^3 - 3^2) \cdot (11 - 1) & \text{(since 3 and 11 are prime)}\\
          & = 180. &
\end{align*}
%
Using the hint that $1818181 = (180 \cdot 10101) + 1$,
we can conclude
%
\begin{align*}
26^{1818181} & = 26 \cdot 26^{180 \cdot 10101} & \\
             & \equiv 26 \cdot 1^{10101} \pmod{297} & \text{(by Euler's Theorem)} \\
             & = 26. &
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
