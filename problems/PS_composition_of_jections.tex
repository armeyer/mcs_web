\begin{problem}
  Let $f:A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ be functions and $h:A \to C$ be their
  composition, namely, $h(a) \eqdef g(f(a))$ for all $a \in A$.
\bparts
  \ppart Prove that if $f$ and $g$ are surjections, then so is $h$.

  \ppart Prove that if $f$ and $g$ are bijections, then so is $h$.

  \ppart If $f$ is a bijection, then so is $\inv{f}$.
