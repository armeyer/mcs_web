\begin{problem}
Figures 1--4 show different pictures of planar graphs.

\mfigure{!}{6.5in}{figures/cp7mfigs-new}


\begin{staffnotes}
Letters labelling vertices are hard to read.  Make sure you know what
they are.  A better figure would be appreciated.

\bparts

\ppart For each picture, describe its discrete faces (simple cycles that
define the region borders).

\begin{solution}
Figs 1 \& 2: abda, bcdb, abcda.
Fig 3: abcdea, adea,abda,bcdb.  Fig 4: abcda, abdea, bdcb, adea.
\end{solution}

\ppart Which of the pictured graphs are isomorphic?  Which pictures
represent the same \emph{planar embedding}? -- that is, they have the same
discrete faces.

\begin{solution}
  Figs 1 \& 2 have the same faces, so are different pictures of the
  \emph{same} planar drawing.  Figs 3 \& 4 both have four faces, but they
  are different, for example, Fig 3 has a face with 5 edges, but the
  longest face in Fig 4 has 4 edges.
\end{solution}

\ppart Describe a way to construct the embedding in Figure 4 according to
the recursive Definition~\bref{embeddingdef} of planar embedding.  For
each application of a constructor rule, be sure to indicate the faces
(cycles) to which the rule was applied and the cycles which result from
the application.

\begin{solution}
  Here's one way.  (By Lemma~\bref{switch-edges}, the constructor steps
  could be done in any order.)

\begin{staffnotes}
Make sure students write out the full set of faces at each step as in the solution below.
