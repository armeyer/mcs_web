\begin{problem}[6]
  Suppose that {\em Let's Make a Deal} is played according to slightly
  different rules and with a red goat and a blue goat.  There are three
  doors, with a prize hidden behind one of them and the goats behind the
  others.  The contestant is allowed to pick a door and ask a single
  question that the host then answers honestly.  The contestant may then
  stick with their chosen door, or switch to one of the other doors.

  \bparts
  \ppart[2] If the contestant asks ``is there is a goat behind one 
  of the unchosen doors?'' and the host answers ``yes,'' is the contestant 
  more likely to win the prize if they stick, switch, or does it not 
  matter?  Justify your answer for full credit.

\begin{solution}
  It doesn't matter.  There will always be a goat
  behind one of the unchosen doors and so there is no new information 
  provided.  The probability of winning is still $1/3$ regardless of 
  whether they stick or switch.
\end{solution}

  \ppart[4] If the contestant asks ``is the red goat behind one 
  of the unchosen doors?'' and the host answers ``yes,'' is the contestant 
  more likely to win the prize if they stick, switch, or does it not 
  matter?  Justify your answer for full credit.

\begin{solution}
They are more likely to win if they stick.  
  
To model the stick strategy, we can use three equally likely outcomes
corresponding to the contestant picking the door with the prize, the
red goat or the blue goat.  The contestant wins in one outcome ---when
he picks the prize.  Being given that the red goat is behind an
unchosen door excludes the outcome of picking the red goat, leaving
only a winning outcome and an equally likely losing outcome, so
sticking leads to a probability of winning equal to $1/2$.

For the switch strategy, we can use six equally likely outcomes
corresponding to what's behind the picked door and then what's behind
the switched-to door.  Given that the red goat is behind an unchosen
door rules out two of the outcomes, leaving four equally likely
outcomes for which the red goat is not behind the door first picked by
the contestant.  In two of these outcomes, the contestant first picks
the door with the prize, so these are both losing outcomes under the
switch strategy.  In the other two outcomes, the contestant first
picks the door with the blue goat and then switches either to the red
goat or the prize.  The contestant wins only in the outcome where he
switches to the prize.  So the contestant wins in only one of the four
outcomes, and therefore switching wins with probability only $1/4$.
