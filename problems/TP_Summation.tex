\begin{problem}
There is a number~$a$ such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty i^p
\]
converges to a finite value iff $p < a$.

What is the value of \emph{a}? \hfill\examrule

\begin{solution}
$-1$.
\end{solution}

\ppart

\inhandout{Circle all}\inbook{Indicate all} of the following that
would be good approaches as part of a proof that this value of~$a$ is
correct.

\begin{romanlist}

\item\label{int1fxp} Find a closed form for 
\[
\int_1^\infty x^p \, \text{d}x .
\]

\item Find a closed form for 
\[
\int_1^\infty i^p \, \text{d}p .
\]

\item Induction on $p$.

\item Induction on $n$ using the following sum 
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^n i^p .
\]

\item\label{compHar} Compare the series term-by-term with the Harmonic
  series.
\end{romanlist}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{\eqref{int1fxp} and \eqref{compHar}}.

\eqref{int1fxp} is correct because $x^p$ is decreasing in $x$ if $p <
0$ and increasing if $p \geq 0$.  So by
Theorem~\bref{weak_increasing_sum_bounds}, the sum can be approximated
by the integral
\[
\int_1^\infty x^p \, \text{d}x = \begin{cases}
  \frac{-1}{p+1} & \text{ if } p < -1,\\
  \infty & \text{ if } p \geq -1.
\end{cases}
\]
So if $p < -1$, Theorem~\bref{weak_increasing_sum_bounds} implies that
the sum is bounded above by one plus the integral.  Since the sum is
increasing, this implies has a finite limit, that is, it converges.

Likewise, the sum is bounded below by the integral, and so
diverges if $p \geq -1$.

\eqref{compHar} is correct because for $p = -1$, the sum is the
harmonic series which we know diverges.  But for $p \geq -1$, the
value of $i^{p}$ increases with~$p$, the sum will be larger, and hence
also diverge for~$p > -1$.

Induction on $n$ is not a plausible approach becuase ideas from the
other approaches would be needed to handle the induction step anyway,
at which point the induction would be moot.
