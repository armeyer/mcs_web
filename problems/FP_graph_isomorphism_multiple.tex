\begin{problem} \mbox{}

Circle the simple graph properties below that are  \textbf{preserved under
isomorphism}.

\bparts


\ppart There is a cycle that includes all the vertices.

\ppart The vertices can be numbered 1 through $2^4$.

\ppart Two edges are of equal length.

%\ppart The graph remains connected if any two edges are removed.

\ppart There exists an edge that is an edge of every spanning tree.

%\ppart The negation of a property that is preserved under isomorphism.

%\ppart There are exacty two spanning trees.

\ppart The $\QOR$ of two properties that are preserved under isomorphism.

%\ppart The graph remains connected if a vertex is removed.
