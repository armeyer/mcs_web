\begin{problem}
A collection $\mathcal{C}$ of sets is called a \emph{chain} when,
given any two sets in $\mathcal{C}$, one is a subset of the other.
Prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is chain of \emph{finite} sets, then
$\lgunion \mathcal{F}$ is countable.  (Notice that without the chain
condition, every set is the union of its finite subsets.)

\begin{solution}
Define the \emph{height} of an element $f \in \lgunion \mathcal{F}$
to be the smallest $n$ such that $f \in F$ for some size $n$ set $F
\in \mathcal{F}$.  Every $f \in \lgunion \mathcal{F}$ has a
well-defined height by WOP.  Since $\mathcal{F}$ is a chain, no two
sets can be the same size; this implies that there are only finitely
many elements of any given height.  So we can list the elements of
$\lgunion \mathcal{F}$ in order of height, with elements of the same
1height listed in arbitrary order, proving that
$\lgunion \mathcal{F}$ is countable.
\end{solution}
