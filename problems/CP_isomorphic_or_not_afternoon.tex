\begin{problem}
  There are four isomorphisms between these two graphs. List them.
  (Partial credit for listing at least two.)

\begin{figure}[h]
\graphic[height=3in]{iso_graphs_afternoon}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
These are the vertex correspondences for the four isomorphisms: \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E, 6F \\
1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5F, 6E \\
1B, 2A, 3D, 4C, 5E, 6F \\
1B, 2A, 3D, 4C, 5F, 6E
\end{solution}
