\begin{problem}
\bparts

\ppart Give an example of a planar graph with two planar embeddings,
where the first embedding has a face whose length is not equal to the
length of any face in the secoind embedding.

\begin{solution}
Class problem~\bref{CP_planar_embedding_isomorphism} has one example,
and slides
\href{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring11/slides8w.pdf}{Slides
  8W} has another.
\end{solution}

\ppart Define the length of a planar embedding, $\mathcal{E}$, to be
the sum of the lengths of the faces of $\mathcal{E}$.  Prove that all
embeddings of the same planar graph have the same length.

\begin{solution}
Each edge has exactly two occurrences on the faces of an embedding, so
the length of an embedding is always twice the number of edges in the
graph.
\end{solution}
