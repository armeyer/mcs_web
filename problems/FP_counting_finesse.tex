\begin{problem}[5]
If the letters in the word FINESSED are randomly permuted, what is the
probability that all the vowels are adjacent?

\begin{center}
\exambox{1.75in}{0.75in}{-0.3in}
\end{center}

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{3}{28}
\]

There are $\binom{8}{2,2,1,1,1,1}= 8!/4$ equally likely permutations.
There are $\binom{6}{2,1,1,1,1}=6!/2$ permutations of FNSSD along with the
block of vowels (EEI), and $\binom{3}{2,1}=3$ permutations of the vowel
block, so the probability that all vowels are adjacent is
\[
(6!/2)3/(8!/4) = 3/28.
\]

\end{solution}
