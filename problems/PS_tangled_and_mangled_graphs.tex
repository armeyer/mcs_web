\begin{problem}
An edge is said to \emph{leave} a set of vertices if one end of the edge
is in the set and the other end is not.  An $n$-node graph is said to be
{\em tangled} if there is an edge leaving every set of
$\ceil{\frac{n}{3}}$ or fewer vertices.  As a special case, the graph
consisting of a single node is considered tangled.  (Recall that the
notation $\ceil{x}$ refers to the smallest integer $\ge x$.)

\begin{problemparts}

\problempart Find the error in the proof of the following
\begin{falseclm*}

Every non-empty, tangled graph is connected.

\begin{falseproof}

The proof is by strong induction on the number of vertices in the graph.
Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that if an $n$-node graph is tangled, then
it is connected.  In the base case, $P(1)$ is true because the graph
consisting of a single node is trivially connected.

For the inductive case, assume $n \geq 1$ and $P(1), \ldots, P(n)$ hold.
We must prove $P(n+1)$, namely, that if an $(n+1)$-node
graph is tangled, then it is connected.

So let $G$ be a tangled, $(n+1)$-node graph.  Choose $\ceil{n/3}$ of the
vertices and let $G_1$ be the tangled subgraph of $G$ with these vertices
and $G_2$ be the tangled subgraph with the rest of the vertices.  Note
that since $n \geq 1$, the graph $G$ has a least two vertices, and so both
$G_1$ and $G_2$ contain at least one vertex.  Since $G_1$ and $G_2$ are
tangled, we may assume by strong induction that both are connected.  Also,
since $G$ is tangled, there is an edge leaving the vertices of $G_1$ which
necessarily connects to a vertex of $G_2$.  This means there is a path
between any two vertices of $G$: a path within one subgraph if both
vertices are in the same subgraph, and a path traversing the connecting
edge if the vertices are in separate subgraphs.  Therefore, the entire
graph, $G$, is connected.  This completes the proof of the inductive case,
and the Claim follows by strong induction.

\end{falseproof}
\end{falseclm*}

\begin{solution}
The error is in the statement, ``Let $G_1$ be the
\emph{tangled} subgraph \dots.''  This makes the implicit assumption
that a tangled graph can be split into tangled subgraphs, one of which
is of size at most $\ceil{\frac{n}{3}}$.  This assumption is false. To
see why, consider the counterexample given in the next part. That
graph is tangled and $\ceil{\frac{n}{3}}=2$.  But, no matter how we
split the graph into two subgraphs of sizes either 2~and~4 or 1~and~5,
one of the two is going to not be tangled.

It's a common blunder to assume that a property of a graph is
``inherited'' by a subgraph.  This is true for many familiar properties
such as being $k$-colorable, having degrees bounded by a constant $d$,
being planar, being no larger than the whole graph.  But many other
familiar are not inherited, for example, being a tree, being a simple
cycle, requiring more than $k$ colors, being nonplanar.
\end{solution}

\problempart Draw a tangled graph that is not connected.

\begin{solution} A tangled but non-connected graph is the following:

\end{center}
\end{solution}


\problempart 
An $n$-node graph is said to be {\em mangled} if there is
an edge leaving every set of $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ or fewer
vertices.  Again, as a special case, the graph consisting of a single
node is considered mangled.  Prove the following claim.

\bigskip

{\bf Claim.} Every non-empty, mangled graph is connected.

\begin{solution}
The proof is by contradiction.  Assume for the purpose of
contradiction that these exists an $n$-node graph that is mangled, but
not connected.  Then the graph must have at least two connected
components.  However, there can be at most one connected component
with more than $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ vertices, since the graph has
only $n$ vertices in total.  Therefore, there exists a connected
component with $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ or fewer vertices.  Since the
graph is mangled, there is an edge leaving this component.  But this
contradicts the definition of a connected component.
\end{solution}
