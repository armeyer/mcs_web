\begin{problem}
A guard is going to release exactly two of the three prisoners,
Sauron, Voldemort, and Bunny Foo Foo, and he's equally likely to
release any set of two prisoners.
\bparts

\ppart\label{Vreleaseprob} What is the probability that Voldemort will
be released?
\begin{center}

\eparts

The guard will truthfully tell Voldemort the name of one of the
prisoners to be released.  We're interested in the following events:
\begin{description}

\item[\ \ $V$:] \emph{V}oldemort is released.

\item[\textbf{``$F$''}:] The guard tells Voldemort that \emph{F}oo Foo will be released.

\item[\textbf{``$S$''}:] The guard tells Voldemort that \emph{S}auron will be released.

\end{description}

The guard has two rules for choosing whom he names:
\begin{itemize}

\item never say that Voldemort will be released,

\item if both Foo Foo and Sauron are getting released, say ``Foo Foo.''

\end{itemize}


\begin{editingnotes}
PPART Draw a tree to represent the sample space, clearly indicating
which outcomes in the the events $V$, \textbf{``$F$''}, and
\textbf{``$S$''}.

\begin{center}
\exambox{0.5in}{0.5in}{0.2in}

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{1}{2}\ ,
\]
because
\[
\prcond{V}{\textbf{``$F$''}} = \frac{ \pr{V \intersect \textbf{``$F$''} }}{ \pr{\textbf{``$F$''}} }
       = \frac{ 1/3 }{ 2/3 } = \frac{1}{2}\ .

\problempart Show how to use the Law of Total Probability to combine
your answers to parts~\eqref{VgiveFF} and~\eqref{VgiveSa} to verify
that the result matches the answer to part~\eqref{Vreleaseprob}.
