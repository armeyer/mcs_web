\begin{problem}
  Let $\infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ be the set of infinite sequences
  containing only the numbers 1, 2, and 3.  For example, some sequences of
  this kind are:
\begin{align*}
(1, 1, 1, 1 ...),\\
(2, 2, 2, 2 ...),\\
(3, 2, 1, 3 ...).
\end{align*}
  Prove that $\infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ is \idx{uncountable}.

  \hint One approach is to define a surjective function from
  $\infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ to the power set $\power(\naturals)$.

\begin{solution}
  
  \begin{proof}
    We can define a surjective function from
    $f:\infstring{\set{1,2,3}} \to \power(\naturals)$ as follows:
   \[
    f(s) \eqdef \set{n \in \naturals \suchthat s[n] = 1}
   \]
   where $s[n]$ is the $n$th element of sequence $s$.

    Now if there was a surjective function from $g: \naturals \to
    \infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$, then the composition of $f$ and $g$ would be
    a surjective function from $\naturals$ to $\power(\naturals)$
    contradicting Cantor's Theorem~\bref{powbig}.
    \end{proof}

Alternatively, to show that $\infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ is uncountable,
we can directly use a basic diagonal argument to show that no
function, $\sigma: \naturals \to \to \infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ is a
surjection.

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma$ be a function from $\naturals$ 
to the infinite sequences of 1's, 2's, and 3's, that is,
\[
\sigma: \naturals \to \to \infstring{\set{1,2,3}}.
\]
To show that $\sigma$ is not a surjection, we will describe a
sequence, diag, of 1's, 2's, and 3's that is not in the range of
$\sigma$.

Let $r:\set{1,2,3}\to \set{1,2,3}$ be defined by
\begin{align*}
r(1) & \eqdef 2,\\
r(2) & \eqdef 3,\\
r(3) & \eqdef 1.\\
\end{align*}
In particular $r(i) \neq i$ for $i=1,2,3$.  
Define a sequence $\text{diag} \in \to
    \infstring{\set{1,2,3}}$ as follows:
\[
\text{diag}[n] \eqdef r(\sigma(n)[n]).
\]
Now by definition,
\[
\text{diag}[n] \neq \sigma(n)[n],
\]
for all $n \in \naturals$, proving that diag is not equal to
$\sigma(n)$ for any $n \in \naturals$.  That is, diag is not in the
range of $\sigma$ as claimed.
\end{proof}
 
\end{solution}
