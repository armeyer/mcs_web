\begin{problem}
The most famous application of stable matching was in assigning
graduating medical students to hospital residencies.  Each hospital has a
preference ranking of students and each student has a preference order of
hospitals, but unlike the setup in the notes where there are an equal
number of boys and girls and monogamous marriages, hospitals generally have
differing numbers of available residencies, and the total number of
residencies may not equal the number of graduating students.  Modify the
definition of stable matching so it applies in this situation, and explain
how to modify the Mating Ritual so it yields stable assignments of students
to residencies.  No proof is required.

\begin{solution}
The Mating Ritual can be applied to this situation by letting the students
be the boys and each of the \emph{residencies} (not the hospitals) be the
girls.

A matching is an assignment of students to residencies (an injection, $A:
\text{students} \to \text{residencies}$) such that every student has a
residency ($A$ is total), or every residency has an assigned student ($A$
is a surjection).  A stable assignment is one with no \emph{rogue couples},
where a rogue couple is a hospital student pair $(H,S)$ such that $S$ is
not assigned to one of the residencies at $H$, which she prefers over
her current assignment, and
\begin{itemize}
\item $H$ has some students assigned to some of its residencies and
prefers $S$ to at least one of its assigned students, or

\item $H$ has none of its residencies assigned,

\end{itemize}

\end{solution}
