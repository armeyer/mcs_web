\begin{problem}
Use strong induction to prove that $n \leq 3^{n/3}$ for every
integer $n \geq 0$.

\begin{solution}
The proof is by strong induction.  Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that
$n \leq 3^{n/3}$.  First, we show that $P(0)$, $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$,
and $P(4)$ are true.  The right hand side of each of the implications
below follows from the left hand side by taking cube roots:
\begin{align*}
0^3 \leq 3^0 & \QIMPLIES\  0 \leq 3^{0/3} \\
1^3 \leq 3^1 & \QIMPLIES\  1 \leq 3^{1/3} \\
2^3 \leq 3^2 & \QIMPLIES\  2 \leq 3^{2/3} \\
3^3 \leq 3^3 & \QIMPLIES\  3 \leq 3^{3/3} \\
4^3 \leq 3^4 & \QIMPLIES\  4 \leq 3^{4/3}
\end{align*}

Next, we show that $P(0), \ldots, P(n)$ imply $P(n + 1)$ for all $n
\geq 4$.  Thus, we assume that $P(0), \dots, P(n)$ are all true and
reason as follows:

\begin{align*}
3^{(n + 1)/3}
    & =    3 \cdot 3^{(n-2)/3} \\
    & \geq 3 \cdot (n - 2) \\
    & \geq n + 1 &\text{(for all $n \geq 7/2$)}
\end{align*}

The first step is algebra.  The second step uses our assumption $P(n -
2)$.  The third step is a linear inequality that holds for all $n \geq
7/2$.  (This forced us to deal individually with the cases $P(3)$ and
$P(4)$, above.)  Therefore, $P(n + 1)$ is true, and so $P(n)$ is true
for all $n \geq 0$ by induction.
\end{solution}
