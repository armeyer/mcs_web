\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Fermat's Little Theorem


What is $\rem{24^{78}}{79}$?

Hint: You should not need to do any calculation!

\begin{solution}

1

Since 79 is prime and 24 is not a
multiple of 79, Fermat's Little Theorem is applicable, and it implies that
$24^{(79-1)}$ is congruent to 1 modulo~79.  This
means that $\rem{24^{78}}{79} = 1$.
\end{solution}
