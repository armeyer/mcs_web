Which of the graphs above are trees?

\begin{solution}
Graphs 2 and~4 are trees, since they are both connected and
acyclic. In contrast, graphs 1 and~3 are not trees: graph~1 is
disconnected, while graph~3 contains a cycle.
\end{solution}

%% 
%% Answer with a sequence of integers separated
%%    by some spaces, for example,
%% 
%% \begin{equation*}
%% 4 3 2
