\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Conditional Probability

Let
\begin{align*}
A & ::= \text{the event that Albert is giving the lecture},  \\
L & ::= \text{the event that Louis Reasoner goes to lecture},  \\
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
    \pr{A} & = 0.8, \\
    \pr{L} & = 0.4.
\end{align*}

Also, the probability that Louis goes to lecture, given that Albert is
giving the lecture, is 0.3.

What is the probability that Albert is giving the lecture, given that
Louis Reasoner goes to lecture? 

\begin{solution}

0.6

Straightforward use of the \emph{a posteriori} probability formula.
By definition
\begin{align*}
Pr{A | L} \cdot \pr{L}
 & = \pr{A \intersect L} \\
 & = \pr{L | A} \cdot \pr{A}.
\end{align*}
Solving for $\pr{A | L}$ gives

\begin{equation*}
\pr{A | L} = Pr{L | A} \cdot Pr{A}/Pr{L} = (0.3  \cdot  0.8)/0.4 = 0.6.
\end{equation*}

\end{solution}
