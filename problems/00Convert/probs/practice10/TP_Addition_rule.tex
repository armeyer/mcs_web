\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Addition rule

What is the probability that you roll a total of 7 or 11 when you roll
two dice?

\begin{solution}
2/9

The events of rolling a 7 and rolling a 11 are disjoint so we can add
the probabilities of each to get the answer.  First, there are $6
\cdot 6=36$ total outcomes for rolling two dice, and each outcome is
equally likely to occur.  The event of the dice totalling 7 consists
of the 6 outcomes (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1).  The
probability of this event is therefore $6/36 = 1/6$.  The event of the
dice totalling 11 consists of the 2 outcomes (5,6) and (6,5).  The
probability of this event is $2/36 = 1/18$.  Adding the two up, $1/6 +
1/18 = 2/9$.
