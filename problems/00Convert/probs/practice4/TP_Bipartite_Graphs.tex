\end{center}

Which of the graphs above are bipartite?  

%%  Give your answer as a
%%  sequence of the labels separated by some spaces in any order such as
%%  
%%  \begin{equation*}
%%  b a
%%  \end{equation*}
%%  
%%  Don't use commas or parentheses.

\begin{solution}
a

Graph~a is bipartite: The first color is assigned to the top-left,
bottom-middle, and top-right vertices; the second color is assigned to
the other three vertices.


Graphs b and~c are not bipartite, as they contain cycles of odd
length.
\end{solution}
