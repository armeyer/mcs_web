\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Magic Card Trick

Suppose you were trying to communicate an integer between 1 and~$n$ to
a partner by holding up three cards from a 52-card deck for her to
see.  Identify all expressions that represent the largest $n$ for
which you could be sure of doing this.

% Give your answer as a sequence of numbers, separated by spaces, such as
% \begin{equation*}
% 3 5 2
% \end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{52!}{3!}$
\item $\frac{52!}{49!}$
\item $\frac{52!}{50!}$
\item ${52 \choose 3}$
\item ${52 \choose 5}$
\item ${49 \choose 3}$
\item ${52 \choose 3}\cdot 3!$
\item ${52 \choose 4}\cdot 4!$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

2,
7

There are $52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50$ possible three-card sequences to show
your partner.  This is equal to both $\frac{52!}{49!}$ and
$\binom{52}{3}\cdot 3!\ .$
\end{solution}
