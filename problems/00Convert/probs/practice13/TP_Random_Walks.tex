\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Random Walks

Consider the following random-walk graphs:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{random_walks}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart
Find $d(x)$ for a stationary distribution for graph~1.

\begin{solution}
1/2
\end{solution}

\ppart
Find $d(y)$ for a stationary distribution for graph~1.

\begin{solution}
1/2
\end{solution}

\ppart

If you start at node $x$ in graph~1 and take a (long) random walk,
does the distribution over nodes ever get close to the stationary
distribution?

\begin{solution}
No

No, you will just alternate between nodes $x$ and $y$.
\end{solution}

\ppart
Find $d(w)$ for a stationary distribution for graph~2.

\begin{solution}
9/19

Found by solving $d(w)=.9d(z)$, $d(z)=d(w)+.1d(z)$, and $d(w)+d(z)=1$
simultaneously.
\end{solution}

\ppart

Find $d(z)$ for a stationary distribution for graph~2.

\begin{solution}
10/19
\end{solution}

\ppart

If you start at node $w$ in graph~2 and take a (long) random walk,
does the distribution over nodes ever get close to the stationary
distribution?  Try a few steps to see what is happening.

\begin{solution}
Yes
\end{solution}

\ppart

How many stationary distributions are there for graph~3?

\begin{solution}
infinitely many
\end{solution}

\ppart

If you start at node $b$ in graph~3 and take a (long) random walk, the
probabililty you are at node~$d$ will be close to:

\begin{solution}
1/3
\end{solution}
