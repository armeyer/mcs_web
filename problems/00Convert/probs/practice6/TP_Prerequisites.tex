\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Prerequisites

The prerequisites of some MIT subjects are given in the following table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{.6\textwidth}{@{}l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}l@{}}
Direct Prerequisites    & Subject \\
18.01 & 6.042 \\

18.01 & 18.02 \\

18.01 & 18.03 \\

8.01 & 8.02 \\

8.01 & 6.01 \\

6.042 & 6.046 \\

18.02, 18.03, 8.02, 6.01
& 6.02 \\

6.01, 6.042 & 
6.006
\\

6.01 & 
6.034
\\

6.02 & 
6.004
\end{tabular*}
\end{center}

\bparts

\ppart 
What is the minimum number of terms in which all these subjects can be
completed?

\begin{solution}
4

Three consective subjects must be completed before 6.004 can be taken.
\end{solution}

\ppart
With a 3 subject limit per term, what is the minimum number of terms
in which all these subjects can be completed?

\begin{solution}

5

6.02 has four second term prerequisites, which with a 3 subject limit
forces at least one to be postponed to the third term. So 6.02
couldn't be taken till the fourth term, pushing 6.004 to term~5.
\end{solution}
