\begin{problem} \mbox{}

Circle the invalid implication, and provide a counter model for your answer.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\exists y, \forall x. P(x, y) \implies \forall x, \exists y. P(x, y)$
\item $\forall x, \exists y. P(x, y) \implies \exists y, \forall x. P(x, y)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
The second implication, $\forall x, \exists y. P(x, y) \implies
\exists y, \forall x. P(x, y)$, is invalid.

An example counter model is the predicate $P(x, y) = y < x$ where the
domain of discourse is $\mathbb{R}$. For every real number $x$, there
exists a real number $y$ which is strictly less than $x$. So while the
antecedent of the implication is true, the consequence is not since
there is no minimum element for the partial order, the strictly less
than relation, $<$, on $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{solution}
