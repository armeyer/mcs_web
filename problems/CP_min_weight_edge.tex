\begin{problem}

\iffalse
A \emph{weighted graph} is a graph with a function that assigns a
nonnegative real number to each edge.  The real number assigned to an
edge is called its \emph{weight}.  The weight of the graph is the sum
of the weights of its edges.

A \emph{minimum weight spanning tree} of a weighted graph is a
spanning tree with the smallest weight of any spanning tree of the
graph.

An example would be nice.
\end{editingnotes}

Let $G$ be a weighted graph and suppose there is a unique edge $e \in
\edges{G}$ with smallest weight, that is, $w(e) < w(f)$ for all edges
$f \in \edges{G} - \set{e}$.  Prove that any minimum weight spanning
tree (MST) of $G$ must include $e$.

\begin{solution}
Suppose $e$ is not included in some MST, $T$.  Since $T$ is a tree, If
we add $e$ to $T$, then we obtain a connected spanning subgraph $T+e$
with a cycle that includes $e$.

Let $f$ be another edge on this cycle.  Now remove $f$ to obtain the
graph $(T + e) - f$.  Then
\begin{enumerate}

\item $(T + e) - f$ is still a connected spanning subgraph of $G$,
  because removing an edge, $f$, on a cycle does not change
  connectedness.

\item $(T + e) - f$ is a tree, because it is a connected subgraph with
  the same number of vertices and edges as the tree $T$.

\item $w((T + e) - f) = w(T) - (w(f) - w(e)) < w(T)$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
