What is the expected sum of the numbers that come up when you roll
a 6-sided die (numbered 1-6) and a 12-sided die (numbered 1-12)?

\begin{solution}
10.

The expectation of a sum is the sum of the individual expectations, so

\begin{equation*}
(1+2+\dots +6)/6 + (1+2+\dots +12)/12 = 7/2 + 13/2=10.
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}

Suppose you have two computers: Computer~1 generates a random number
in the set $[1, 99]$ with all numbers equally likely.  Similarly,
Computer~2 generates a random number in ~$[1,999]$ with all numbers
equally likely.

You roll a fair six-sided die.  If a 5 comes up, you generate a random
number using Computer 1, otherwise you generate a random number using
Computer 2.  What is the expected value of the number you generate?

\begin{solution}

$2550/6$

By the law of Total Expectation,
\begin{align*}
\expect{\text{generated number}}
    & = \pr{\text{roll $5$}} \cdot \expect{\text{Computer 1 number}}
        + \pr{\QNOT(\text{roll $5$})} \cdot \expect{\text{Computer 2 number}}\\
    & = (1/6)50+(5/6)500 \\
    & = 2550/6.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart Assume that Computers 1 and 2 act independently.  If you
generate one random number with each computer, what is the expected
value of their product?

\begin{solution}
25000.

The Product Rule can be used because the two random variables are
independent, so
\begin{align*}
\Ex[C_{1} \cdot C_{2}] & = \expect{C_{1}} \cdot \expect{C_{2}} \\ & =
50 \cdot 500 \\ & = 25000.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
