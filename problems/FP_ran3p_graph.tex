The figure above shows a 3-vertex random walk graph (with the edge
probabilities ommited for readability).  For $X,Y \in \set{A,B,C}$,
let $p_{XY}$ denote the probability of the edge $\diredge{X}{Y}$.

Let $a$ be the expected length of a random walk that starts at vertex
$A$ and reaches vertex $C$ for the first time.  Likewise, let $b$ be
the expected length of a random walk that starts at $B$ and reaches
$C$ for the first time.  Write a system of linear equations that can
be solved to yield simple expressions for $a$ and $b$ in terms of
$p_{XY}$'s for $X,Y \in \set{A,B,C}$.  You do \emph{not} need to solve
for $a$ or $b$.

\begin{solution}
Let $b$ be the expected length of a random walk that starts at $B$ and
reaches vertex $C$ for the first time.  Then by Conditional
Expectation we have

\begin{align*}
a & = p_{AC}\cdot 1 + p_{AB} \cdot (1 + b) + p_{AA}\cdot (1 + a)\\
b & = p_{BC}\cdot 1 + p_{BA} \cdot (1 + a) + p_{BB}\cdot (1 + b).
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
