\begin{problem}
The hat-check staff has had a long day serving at a party, and at the
end of the party they simply return the $n$ checked hats in a random
way such that the probability that any particular person gets their
own hat back is $1/n$.

Let $X_i$ be the \idx{indicator variable} for the $i$th person getting
their own hat back.  Let $S_n$ be the total number of people who get
their own hat back.

\begin{problemparts}

\ppart What is the expected number of people who get their own hat back?

\begin{solution}
$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, so by \idx{linearity of expectation},
\[
\expect{S_n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \expect{X_i}.
\]
Since the probability a person gets their own hat back is $1/n$, therefore
$\pr{X_i=1} = 1/n$. Now, since $X_i$ is an
indicator, we have $\expect{X_i} = 1/n$.  By linearity of expectation,
\[
\expect{S_n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \expect{X_i} = n\cdot\frac{1}{n} = 1.
\]

\end{solution}

\ppart Write a simple formula for $\expect{X_i \cdot X_j}$ for $i \neq j$.

\hint What is $\prcond{X_j=1}{X_i=1}$?

\examspace[0.7in]

\begin{solution}
We observed above that $\pr{X_i=1} = 1/n$.  Also, given that the
$i$th person got their own hat, each other person has an equal chance of
getting their own hat among the remaining $n-1$ hats.  So
\[
\prcond{X_j=1}{X_i=1} = \frac{1}{n-1},
\]
for $j \neq i$.  Therefore,
\[
\pr{X_i=1 \QAND X_j=1}
  = \prcond{X_j=1}{X_i=1}\cdot \pr{X_i=1} = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}.
\]
But $X_i=1 \QAND X_j=1$ iff $X_i X_j = 1$, so
\[
\expect{X_i X_j} = \pr{X_i X_j =1} = \pr{X_i=1 \QAND X_j=1},
\]
and hence
\[
\expect{X_i X_j} = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Explain why you cannot use the \idx{variance} of sums formula to
calculate $\variance{S_n}$.

\examspace[1in]

\begin{solution}
The principle of additivity of variances requires the variables
be pairwise independent, but the indicator variables for people getting
their hats back are not pairwise independent, since $\prcond{X_j=1}{X_i=1}
= 1/(n-1) \neq 1/n = \pr{X_j=1}$ for $i \neq j$.
