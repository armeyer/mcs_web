\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart How many \emph{positive} integer solutions are there to
equation~\eqref{sumx20}?

\begin{equation}\label{sumx20}
x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5 = 20
\end{equation}

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\binom{19}{4}.
\]

We are basically doing the donut problem with 15 donuts and 5 people.
We have 15 donuts because each person has already been given one
because each person eats a positive number of donuts.
\end{solution}

\ppart How many nonnegative \emph{even} integer solutions are there
to~\eqref{sumx20}?
\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
\[
binom{14}{4}.
\]

This is the same problem as having five nonnegative integers that add
up to 10.  There is a bijection because we can simply double each
number to a solution in even numbers.
\end{solution}

\ppart How many nonnegative \emph{odd} integer solutions are there
to~\eqref{sumx20}?

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
0. If all five numbers are odd, their sum is odd.
\end{solution}
