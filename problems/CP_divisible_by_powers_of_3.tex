\begin{problem}
Let $N$ be a number whose decimal expansion consists of $3^n$
identical digits.  Show by induction that $3^n \divides N$.  For example:
\[
3^2 \divides \underbrace{777777777}_{\text{$3^2 = 9$ digits}}
\]
Recall that $3$ divides a number iff it divides the sum of its digits.

\begin{solution}
We proceed by induction on $n$.  Let $P(n)$ be the
proposition that $3^n \divides N$, where the decimal expansion of $N$
consists of $3^n$ identical digits.

\noindent \textit{Base case.}  $P(0)$ is true because $3^0 = 1$
divides every number.

\noindent \textit{Inductive step.}  Now we show that, for all $n\geq
0$, $P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$.  Fix any $n\geq 0$ and assume $P(n)$ is
true. Consider a number whose decimal expansion consists of $3^{n+1}$
copies of the digit $a$:
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{aaaaaa \dots aaaaaa}_{\text{$3^{n+1}$ digits}}
    & = \underbrace{aaa \dots aaa}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}}
        \underbrace{aaa \dots aaa}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}}
        \underbrace{aaa \dots aaa}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}} \\
    & = \underbrace{aaa \dots aaa}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}}
        \quad \cdot \quad
        1
        \underbrace{000 \dots 001}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}}
        \underbrace{000 \dots 001}_{\text{$3^n$ digits}} \\
\end{align*}
Now $3^n$ divides the first term by the assumption $P(n)$, and 3
divides the second term since the digits sum to 3.  Therefore, the
whole expression is divisible by $3^{n+1}$.  This proves $P(n+1)$.

By the principle of induction $P(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$.

\end{solution}
