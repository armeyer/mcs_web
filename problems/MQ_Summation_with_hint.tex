\begin{problem}

Show that
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty i^p
\end{equation*}
converges to a finite value iff $p < -1$.

\hint How does this summation compare with the Harmonic series?

\begin{solution}
\begin{staffnotes}

\end{staffnotes}

The sum is closely approximated by $\paren{\int_1^\infty x^p \, dx}$, For $p \neq -1$,
the indefinite integral is equal to 
%\begin{equation*}
$\frac{x^{p+1}}{p+1}.$
%\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}

\item
If $p < -1$, then $p+1 < 0$, so $\lim_{x\to \infty} x^{p+1} = 0$, and
the definite integral from 1 to~$\infty$ evaluates to $-1/(p+1)$.
Hence the sum is bounded from above, and since it is increasing, it
has a finite limit, that is, it converges.

\item
If $p > -1$, then $p+1 > 0$, so $\lim_{x \to \infty} x^{p+1} =
\infty$, and the definite integral diverges.

\item
For $p = -1$ the indefinite integral is $\log x$ which also
approaches~$\infty$ as $x$ approaches~$\infty$, so the the definite
integral also diverges.

\end{itemize}

Also, for $p = -1$, the sum is the harmonic series which we know does not
converge. Since the term $i^{p}$ is increasing in~$p$ for $i > 1$, the
sum will be larger, and hence also diverge for~$p > -1$.
