\begin{problem}
Prove that $\log_{50} 20$ is irrational.  You may use whatever familiar facts
about integers and primes you need (Unique Factorization, for example), but
please explicitly state such facts, and explain how they are used in your proof.
  
%\hint Proof by contradiction.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose to the contrary that $\log_{50} 20$ is rational, which means
  \[
  \textcolor{red}{\log_{50} 20 = \frac{m}{n}}
  \]
  for some integers $m, n$ where $n>0$.  So we have
\begin{align}
%  \log_9 12 & = m/n, \notag\\
  50^{\log_{50} 20} & = 50^{m/n}  & \text{(raising 50 to equal powers)},\notag\\
  20 & = 50^{m/n} & \text{(def of $\log_{50}$)},\notag\\
  20^n & = 50^m & \text{(raising both sides to the $n$th power)}.\notag\\
  (5\cdot 2^{2})^n & = (5^2 \cdot 2)^m & \text{(factoring 20 \& 50 into primes)}.\notag\\
  5^n\cdot 2^{2n} & = 5^{2m}\cdot 2^m. \label{factoring}
\end{align}
By the Unique Prime Factorization theorem, the number of $2$s and $5$s on each
side of~\eqref{factoring} must be equal, so $2n = m$ (for the $2$s) and $n = 2m$
(for the $5$s).  This system has only one solution, $n=m=0$, which contradicts
the fact that $n > 0$, as stated above.  So $\log_{50}{20}$ is indeed irrational.

Alternatively, once we know $2n=m$ it follows that $\log_{50}{20} = m/n = 2$
(recall that $n > 0$, so we can divide).  This is a contradiction, because $50^2
\ne 20$.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
\end{problem}
