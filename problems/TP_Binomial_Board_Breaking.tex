\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: Binomial Board Breaking

Bruce Lee, on a movie that didn't go public, is practicing 
by breaking 5 boards with his fists.  He is able to break a board with
probability 0.8 (he is practicing with his left fist, that's why it's 
not 1), and he breaks each board independently.

What is the probability that Bruce breaks exactly 2 out of the 5 boards 
that are placed before him? 


\begin{solution}
$(5! / (3! * 2!)) * (8/10)^2 * (2/10)^3$

This is the standard Binomial probability: There are 5 choose 2 
ways for 2 of the 5 boards to be broken. Each one of these ways happens with probability 
$(0.8)^{2}(0.2)^{3}$. Overall, the probability is: 
\begin{equation*}
C(5,2)  \cdot  (0.8)^{2}  \cdot  (0.2)^{3}
\end{equation*}


\end{solution}

\ppart
What is the probability that Bruce breaks at most 3 out of the 5 boards 
that are placed before him? 

\begin{solution}
$1 - 5*(8/10)^4*(2/10) - (8/10)^5$.

This is 1 minus the probability that 4 or 5 boards will be broken. 
There is 1 way for all 5 boards to be broken, and this happens with probability $(0.8)^{5}$.  
Similarly, there are 5 choose 4 ways for 4 boards to be broken, and each happens with probability
$(0.8)^{4}(0.2)$.  So, the overall probability is:

\begin{equation*}
1 - C(5,4)  \cdot  (0.8)^{4}  \cdot  (0.2) - (0.8)^{5}
\end{equation*}

\end{solution}

\ppart
What is the expected number of boards Bruce will break?

\begin{solution}

4


The expectation of a $(p,n)$-binomial distribution is $pn$.  Here, $p=0.8$ and $n= 5$.
