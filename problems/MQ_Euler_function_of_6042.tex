\problempart
\label{phi}
Calculate the value of $\phi(6042)$. Hint: $53$ is a factor of $6042$
\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\phi(6042) = \phi(2) \phi(3) \phi(19) \phi(53) =  (2 - 1)(3 - 1)(19 - 1)(53 - 1) = 1872.
\]
\end{solution}


\problempart Assume an integer $k > 0$ is relatively prime to 6042.  Explain why
$k \equiv k^{9361} \pmod{6042}$.

\hint Use your solution to part (\ref{phi}).

\begin{solution}
\[
k^{9361} \equiv k^{1872\cdot 5 + 1} \equiv k(k^{1872})^5 \pmod{6042}.
\]  By
Euler's Theorem, since $k$ and 6042 are relatively prime,
$k^{\phi(6042)} \equiv 1 \pmod{6042}$.  By part (a), we have that
$\phi(6042) = 1872$, implying $k^{1872} \equiv 1 \pmod{6042}$.  Hence,
$k(k^{1872})^5 \equiv k (1^5) \equiv k \pmod{6042}$.
\end{solution}
