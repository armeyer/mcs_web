\begin{problem}

One of the implications below is invalid, which one? \exambox{0.2in}{0in}{0.2in}
\begin{align}
\forall x\, \exists y.\, P(x, y) & \QIMPLIES \exists y\, \forall x.\, P(x, y),\label{AEPneq}\\
\exists y\, \forall x.\, P(x, y) & \QIMPLIES \forall x\, \exists y.\, P(x, y).
\end{align}

\examspace[0.2in]

Provide a counter model for this implication with domain of discourse
\[
D \eqdef \set{\True, \False}.
\]
You do not need to explain your answer.

\begin{solution}
The first implication~\eqref{AEPneq} is invalid.

An simple counter model is when the predicate $P(x, y)$ means $x \neq
y$.  (Equivalent ways to define $P(x,y)$ are $\QNOT(x \QIFF y)$ and $x
\QXOR y$.)

The antecedent of the implication is true: for every $x \in D$, there
exists a $y \in D$ which is $\neq x$, namely, let $y$ be $\QNOT(x)$.

The consequent is not true since there is no $x$ that differs from
everything, because $x$ does not differ from itself.
