\ppart Explain why $(-12)^{526}$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo 175.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
  A number has a multiplicative inverse modulo 175 iff it is relatively
  prime to 175.  But the only prime divisors of 175 are 7 and 5, and the
  only prime divisors of $(-12)^{482}$ are the prime divisors of 12, namely
  2 and 3, so $(-12)^{482}$ is relatively prime to 175.
\end{solution}


\ppart What is the value of $\phi(175)$, where $\phi$ is Euler's function?

\begin{center}
\exambox{0.5in}{0.4in}{-0.3in}
\end{center}
\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
  Noting that $175 = 5^2 \cdot 7$.  It follows
  that $\phi(175) = (5^2 - 5^1)(7-1) = 20 \cdot 6 = 120$.
\end{solution}
\end{editingnotes}

\ppart
  Call a number from 0 to 174 \emph{powerful} iff some positive power
  of the number is congruent to 1 modulo 175.  What is the probability
  that a random number from 0 to 174 is powerful?

\begin{center}
\exambox{0.5in}{0.4in}{-0.3in}
\end{center}
\examspace[1.5in]

\begin{solution}
\[
\frac{24}{35}
\]

  Note that $x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n$ for some $k$ iff $x$ has an inverse
  modulo $n$ iff $x$ is relatively prime to $n$.  So being powerful is
  equivalent to being relatively prime to 175.  There are $\phi(175) =
  (5^2 - 5^1)(7-1) = 20 \cdot 6 = 120$ numbers from 0 to 174 that are
  relatively prime to 175, so
  \[
  \pr{\text{powerful}} = \frac{120}{175} = \frac{24}{35}.
  \]
\end{solution}

\ppart
What is the remainder of $(-12)^{482}$ divided by 175?

\begin{center}
\exambox{0.5in}{0.5in}{-0.3in}
\end{center}
\examspace[1.0in]

\begin{solution}
  \textbf{144}.

  Since -12 and 175 are relatively prime, we have by Euler's
  Theorem that $(-12)^{\phi(175)} \equiv 1 \pmod {175}$, and so
  \[
  (-12)^{482} = \paren{(-12)^{120}}^{4} \cdot (-12)^{2}
              \equiv 1^{4} \cdot (144)
              \equiv 144 \pmod {175}.
  \]
\end{solution}
