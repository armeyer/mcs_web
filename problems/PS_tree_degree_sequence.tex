\begin{problem}
Suppose $D = \ang{d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n}$ is a list of the degrees of the
vertices of some $n$-vertex tree $T$ for $n \geq 2$.  That is, we
assume the vertices of $T$ are numbered, and $d_i>0$ is the degree of
the $i$th vertex of $T$.

\ppart Explain why
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tree_degree_seq}
\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 2(n-1).
\end{equation}

\begin{solution}
By the Handshaking Lemma\inbook{~\bref{sumedges}}, the sum of the
degrees of the vertices of $T$ is twice the number of edges, and since
$T$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, it has $n-1$ edges.

Say a finite sequence of $n \geq 2$ positive integers is \emph{good}
when the sum of its elements is $2(n-1)$.

\ppart\label{goodseq} Prove that every good sequence is a list of the
degrees of all the vertices in some tree.

\hint Induction.

\begin{solution}
The proof will be by induction on $n$ with induction hypothesis that
every good sequence of length $n$ is a list of the degrees of the
vertices of a tree.

\inductioncase{Base case} ($n = 2$): The only possible good sequence
is $\ang{1,1}$, which is the list of degrees of a 2-vertex tree.

\inductioncase{Induction step}: Suppose $D$ is a good sequence of
length $n+1$ where $n\geq 2$.  So the sum of the elements in $D$ is
$2n$.  We need to show that $D$ is a list of the degrees of the
vertices of some tree with $n+1$ vertices.

There must be an element of $D$ equal to 1, since otherwise the sum of
the $n+1$ elements of $D$ would be greater that $2n$.  Likewise, $D$
must have an element $d>1$, or else the sum would be $n+1$, which is
less than $2n$ since $n \geq 2$.

Let $D'$ be the length $n$ sequence obtained by deleting from $D$ an
element equal to 1 and replacing an element $d>1$ by $d-1$.  Then
$D'$ is a sequence of $n$ positive integers whose sum is $2n-2 =
2(n-1)$, so $D'$ is also good.

Now by induction hypothesis, $D'$ is the sequence of degrees of the
vertices of some $n$-vertex tree $T'$.  In particular, $T'$ must have
a vertex of degree $d-1$.  Let $T$ be the $(n+1)$-vertex tree obtained
from $T'$ by attaching a new leaf to a vertex of degree $d-1$.  This
implies that $D$ is a list of the vertex degrees of $T$, which
completes the proof of the inductive step.
\end{solution}

\ppart Show that if $D$ is a good sequence, then the elements of $D$
can each be assigned one of two colors, say ``red'' and ``black,''
such that the sum of the red elements equals the sum of the black
elements.

\begin{staffnotes}
\hint Trees are bipartite.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
By part~\eqref{goodseq}, we know that $D$ is sequence of vertex
degrees of a tree $T$.  Since trees are bipartite graphs, there exists
a partition of the vertices into sets $V_1,V_2$ such that any edge
connects a vertex in $V_1$ with a vertex in $V_2$.  The sum of the
degrees of the vertices in $V_1$ is equal to the number of edges of
the graph since each edge is incident to exactly one vertex in $V_1$.
Similarly, the sum of the degrees of the vertices in $V_2$ is also the
number of edges.  So we obtain the desired coloring of the elements of
$D$ by coloring red the elements corresponding to vertices $V_1$, and
coloring black the elements of $D$ corresponding to vertices $V_2$.
