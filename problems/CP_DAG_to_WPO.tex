\begin{problem}
Prove that if $R$ is the graph of a DAG, then the walk relation, $R^*$, is
a weak partial order on the vertices.

\begin{solution}
\emph{reflexive}: Every vertex, $a$, is connected to itself by
a 0-length path, so $aR^*a$ holds for all $a$.

\emph{antisymmetric}: Suppose $a\neq b$ and $aR^*b$, that is, there is
a (necessarily positive length) walk from $a$ to $b$.  If $bR^*a$ also
held, then there is also a walk from $b$ to $a$, and the two paths
could be merged into a positive length closed walk.  Then
Lemma~\bref{shortestclosedwalk_lem} implies the graph has a positive
length cycle, contradicting the fact that the graph is acyclic.  We
conclude that $\QNOT(bR^*a)$, which proves antisymmetry.

\emph{transitive}: $aR^*b$ means there is a walk from $a$ to $b$, and
likewise, $bR^*c$ means there is a walk from $b$ to $c$.  Then the
first walk followed by the second would form a walk from $a$ to $c$.
This implies that $aR^*c$, proving transitivity.
\end{solution}
