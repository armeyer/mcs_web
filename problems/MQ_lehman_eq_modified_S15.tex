\begin{problem}
Use the Well Ordering Principle to prove that the equation
\[
3a^4 + 9b^4 = c^4
\]
has no positive integer solutions. 

%\noindent
%\inhandout{\hint Consider the minimum value of $a$ amongst all possible solutions.}

\begin{solution}
The proof is by the Well Ordering Principle.  Suppose for the sake of
contradiction that there exists a solution $(a,b,c)$.  Then, there
must be a solution in which $a$ has the smallest possible value.

But we will show that if $(a,b,c)$ is a solution, then each of $a, b$,
and $c$ must be multiples of 3.  This implies that $(a/3, b/3, c/3)$
is another solution.  But since $a$ is positive, $a/3 < a$.  This
implies that there cannot be a minimum value for $a$, a contradiction.

Now, we will show that $a, b$, and $c$ must be multiples of three.
The left hand side is a multiple of 3, so $c$ must be a multiple of 3
and we can write $c = 3c'$.  Substituting back gives
\[
3a^4+ 9b^4 = 3^4{c'}^4,
\]
so $3a^4$ must be a multiple of 9, since the other terms are multiples
of 9.  This implies that $a^4$ is divisible by 3, and therefore that
$a$ is a multiple of 3.  Substituting $a = 3a'$ gives:
\[
3^5{a'}^2 + 9b^2 = 3^4{c'}^4
\]

Finally, we see that $9b^4$ must be a multiple of $3^4$, since the
other terms are multiples of $3^4$, which implies that $b$ must be a
multiple of 3.  Therefore, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all multiples of 3,
as claimed.
\end{solution}
