\ppart
Verify that the divisibility relation on the set of nonnegative integers is
a weak partial order.

\begin{solution}
Divisibility is reflexive since $n \divides n$.

It is transitive by Lemma~\bref{lem:div}.\bref{lem:divtrans}.

It is anti-symmetric since if $n \divides m$, then $n \leq m$ for all
positive integers $m$ and nonnegative $n$.  So if $n \divides m$ and
$m \divides n$, then $m \le n$ and $n \le m$, that is, $n=m$.  Also,
if $n \divides 0$ then $n=0$, which confirms anti-symmetry when
$m=-0$.

\end{solution}

\ppart What about the divisibility relation on the set of integers?

\begin{solution}
Divisibility is not antisymmetric on the integers, since $n \divides -n$.
