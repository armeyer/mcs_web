\begin{problem}
A partial order on a set $A$ is \term{well founded} when every
non-empty subset of $A$ has a \emph{\idx{minimal}} element.  For example, the
less-than relation on a well ordered set of real numbers \inbook{(see
  \bref{well_ordering_sec})} is a linear order that is well founded.

Prove that if $R$ and $S$ are well founded partial orders, then so is
their product $R cross S$.
