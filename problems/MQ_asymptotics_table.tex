\begin{problem}

Let $f(n) = n^3$.  For each function $g(n)$ in the table below, indicate
which of the indicated asymptotic relations hold.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
g(n) & f = O(g) & f=o(g) & g = O(f) & g =o(f) \\
\hline\hline
6 -5n - 4n^2 + 3n^3             & & & &  \\ \hline
n^3 \log n                      & & & &  \\ \hline
\paren{\sin\paren{\pi n/2}+2}n^3  & & & &  \\ \hline
n^{\sin(\pi n/2)+2}                  & & & & \\ \hline
\log n!                         & & & & \\ \hline
e^{0.2n} - 100n^3                 & & & & \\\hline
\end{array}
