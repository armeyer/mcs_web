\begin{problem}
What is the remainder of $63^{9601}$ divided by $220$?\hfill \examrule

\iffalse
\hint{$9601= (80 \cdot 120) + 1$; \idx{Euler's theorem}}

\begin{center}
\exambox{1in}{0.75in}{-0.2in}
\end{center}
\fi

\begin{solution} 
\[
63.
\]

Since $63=3^2 \cdot 7$ and $220=2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$ are relatively prime,
Euler's theorem implies that
\[
63^{\phi(220)} \equiv 1 \pmod{220}
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\phi(220) & = \phi(2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11) &\\
          & = \phi(2^2 \cdot 5)\phi(11)   & \text{(since $\gcd(2^2\cdot 5,11)=1$)}\\
          & = \phi(2^2)\phi(5)\phi(11)   & \text{(since $\gcd(2^2,5)=1$)}\\
          & = (2^2-2^1)(5-1)(11-1)   & \text{(since $2$, $5$, and $11$ are prime)}\\
          & = (2)(4)(10)\\
          & = 80. &
\end{align*}

Therefore $63^{80}\equiv 1 \pmod{220}$.

Since $9601 = 80 \cdot 120 + 1$, therefore
%
\begin{align*}
63^{9601} & = 63 \cdot 63^{80 \cdot 120}\\
             & \equiv 63 \cdot 1^{120}\pmod{220}\\
             & \equiv 63\pmod{220}.
\end{align*}
So the remainder of $63^{9601}$ divided by $220$ is $63$.
\end{solution}
