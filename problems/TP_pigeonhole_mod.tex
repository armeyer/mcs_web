\begin{problem}
Indicate how to use the Pigeonhole Principle to determine the smallest
nonnegative integer $n$ such that every set of $n$ integers is
guaranteed to contain three integers that are congruent mod 211.
Clearly indicate what are the pigeons, holes, and rules for assigning
a pigeon to a hole, and give the value of $n$.

\examspace[2in]

\begin{solution}
\[
n = 423.
\]

The $n$ integers are the pigeons, $\Zmod{211}$ is the set of pigeon holes, and a
pigeon is assigned to its remainder on division by 211.  By the Generalized Pigeonhole
Principle, there must be at least
\[
\ceil{\frac{n}{211}}
\]
pigeons in some hole.  So we want the smallest integer $n$ such that
\[
\frac{n}{211} > 2.
\]
\end{solution}
