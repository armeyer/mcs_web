\ppart\label{fhat} For any vertex, $v$, in a graph, let $\neighbors{v}$ be
the set of \term{neighbors} of $v$, namely, the vertices adjacent to $v$:
\[
\neighbors{v} \eqdef \set{u \suchthat \edge{u}{v}\text{ is an edge of the
graph}}.
\]

Suppose $f$ is an isomorphism from graph $G$ to graph $H$.
Prove that $f(\neighbors{v}) = \neighbors{f(v)}$.

Your proof should follow by simple reasoning using the definitions of
isomorphism and neighbors---no pictures or handwaving.

\hint Prove by a chain of iff's that
\[
h \in \neighbors{f(v)} \qiff h \in f(\neighbors{v})
\]
for every $h \in V_H$.  Use the fact that $h=f(u)$ for some $u \in V_G$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $h \in V_H$.  By definition of isomorphism, there is a
  unique $u \in V_G$ such that $f(u)=h$.  Then
\begin{align*}
h \in \neighbors{f(v)}
    & \qiff \edge{h}{f(v)} \in E_H          & \text{(def of $\neighbors{}$)}\\
    & \qiff \edge{f(u)}{f(v)} \in E_H       & \text{(def of $u$)}\\
    & \qiff \edge{u}{v} \in E_V             & \text{(since $f$ is an isomorphism)}\\
    & \qiff u \in \neighbors{v}                      & \text{(def of $\neighbors{}$)}\\
    & \qiff f(u) \in f(\neighbors{v})                & \text{(def of $f$-image)}\\
    & \qiff h \in f(\neighbors{v})                   & \text{(def of $u$)}
\end{align*}
So $\neighbors{f(v)}$ and $f(\neighbors{v})$ have the same members and therefore are equal.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart Conclude that if $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic graphs, then for each
$k \in \naturals$, they have the same number of degree $k$ vertices.

\begin{solution}
By definition, $\degr{v}= \card{\neighbors{v}}$.  Since an isomorphism is a
bijection, any set of vertices and its image under an isomorphism will
be the same size (by the Mapping Rule from Week 2 Notes), so
part~\eqref{fhat} implies that an isomorphism, $f$, maps degree $k$
vertices to degree $k$ vertices.  This means that the image under $f$
of the set of degree $k$ vertices of $G$ is precisely the set of
degree $k$ vertices of $H$.  So by the Mapping Rule again, there are
the same number of degree $k$ vertices in $G$ and $H$.
