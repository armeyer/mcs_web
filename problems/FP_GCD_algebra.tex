\begin{problem}
Prove that $\gcd(mb+ r, b) = \gcd(b, r)$ for all integers $m,b,r$.

\hint We proved a similar result in class when $r$ was a remainder in
$[0,b)$.

\begin{solution}
We know that a number is a common divisor of numbers $x$ and $y$, then
it is a common divisor of any linear combination of $x$ and $y$.

So if $d$ is a common divisor of $mb+r$ and $b$, then it is a divisor of
and $b$ and $1\cdot(mb+r) - m \cdot b = r$.

Conversely, if $d$ is a common divisor $b$ and $r$, then it is a
common divisor of $m \cdot b+ 1 \cdot r$ and $b$.

Since the two pairs $(mb+ r, b)$ and $(b, r)$ have the \emph{same}
common divisors, they must have the same \emph{greatest} common
divisor.

\end{solution}
