\begin{problem}
Prove
\begin{theorem}
\[
\haltswith{C}{\rho}{\rho'} \qiff \mean{C}\rho = \rho'
\]
\end{theorem}
\hint Prove the left to right direction by induction on the number of
steps $C$ needs to halt starting in environment $\rho$.  Prove the
right to left direction by structural induction on the definition of
\while\ programs.  Both proofs follow almost mechanically from the
definitions.

TBA
