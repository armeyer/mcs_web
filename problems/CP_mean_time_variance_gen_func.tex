\ppart\label{varH} A computer program crashes at the end of each hour
of use with probability $1/p$, if it has not crashed already.  If $H$
is the number of hours until the first crash, we know that
$\expect{H}= 1/p$.  What is the \idx{variance} of the number of hours
until the program crashes?

\hint % Equation~\bref{squares_gen_func}:
\[
\sum_1^{\infty} k^2x^k = \frac{x(1+x)}{(1-x)^3}
\]

\begin{solution}
We have
\[
\pr{H=k} = q^{k-1}p
\]
where $q \eqdef 1-p$.  Now
\[
\variance{H}  = \expect{H^2} - \expectsq{H},
\]
But
\begin{align*}
\expect{H^2}
   & \eqdef \sum_{k \in \naturals^{+}} k^2 q^{k-1}p\\
   & =  \frac{p}{q} \sum_{k \in \naturals^{+}} k^2 q^k\\
   & =  \frac{p}{q} \paren{\frac{q(1+q)}{(1-q)^3}} &\text{(hint)}\\
   & =  \frac{1+q}{p^2},
\end{align*}
so
\[
\variance{H}  = \frac{(1+q)}{p^2} - \paren{\frac{1}{p}}^2 = \frac{q}{p^2}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{Cheb} What is the \idx{Chebyshev bound} on
\[
\pr{\abs{H - (1/p)}> x/p}
\]
where $x > 0$?

\begin{solution}

\[
\frac{\variance{H}}{\paren{x/p}^2} = \frac{q}{p^2\paren{x/p}^2} = 
    \frac{q}{x^2}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{Hap} Conclude from part~\eqref{Cheb} that for $a \geq 2$,
\[
\pr{H > a /p} \leq \frac{q}{(a-1)^2}
\]

\hint Check that $\abs{H - (1/p)} > (a-1)/p$ iff  $H > a/p$.

\begin{solution}
Note that if $H \leq 1/p$, then $\abs{H - (1/p)} = (1/p) - H$,
and since $H > 0$, we have $ (1/p) - H < 1/p \leq (a-1)/p$.  It follows
that $\abs{H - (1/p)} > (a-1)/p$ iff $H - (1/p)> (a-1)/p$ iff $H > a/p$.
So
\begin{align*}
\pr{H > a/p} & = \pr{\abs{H - (1/p)} > (a-1)/p}\\
             & \leq q/(a-1)^2 & \text{(by part~\eqref{Cheb})}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\ppart What actually is
\[
\pr{H > a/p}?
\]

Conclude that for any fixed $p>0$, the probability that $H > a/p$ is an
asymptotically smaller function of $a$ than the Chebyshev bound of 
part~\eqref{Hap}.

\begin{solution}

\[
\pr{H > a/p} =  \sum_{k >a/p} q^{k-1}p = pq^{\floor{a/p}} \sum_0^{\infty}
q^j = pq^{\floor{a/p}}\cdot \frac{1}{1-q} = q^{\floor{a/p}}.
\]
So
\[
\pr{H > a/p} \leq q^{(a-p)/p} = \paren{(1-p)^{1/p}}^{a-p} <
\paren{\paren{e^{-p}}^{1/p}}^{a-p} = e^{p-a}.
\]

But Chebyshev gives $\pr{H > a/p} \leq q/(a-1)^2 = \Theta(1/a^2)$.  Since
$e^{p-a} = o(1/a^2)$, we conclude that the actual probability is much
smaller than we got from the Chebyshev Bound.
\end{solution}
