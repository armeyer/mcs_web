\begin{problem}
Indicate which of the following relations below are equivalence
relations, (\textbf{E}), strict partial orders (\textbf{S}), weak
partial orders (\textbf{W}), or \emph{none} of the above (\textbf{N}).

For the partial orders, also indicate whether it is \emph{linear} (\textbf{T}).

For the next parts, let $f,g$ be nonnegative functions from the
integers to the real numbers.
