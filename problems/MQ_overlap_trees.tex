\begin{problem}
  Suppose $G$ is a connected simple graph with $n$ vertices and $2n-3$
  edges.  Prove that it is impossible to find two spanning trees of $G$
  that do not share some edge.

\begin{solution}
  Every spanning tree of $G$ must have $n-1$ edges.  If two such trees did
  not share an edge, then there would be at least $2n-2$ edges,
  contradicting the fact that there are only $2n-3$ of them,
\end{solution}
