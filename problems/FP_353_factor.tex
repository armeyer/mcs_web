\begin{problem}
Show that 2471 does not have an inverse modulo 3883.

\begin{solution}
2471 and 3883 are not relatively prime, so neither has an inverse
modulo the other.  In particular, they are both divisible by 353:
\begin{align*}
\gcd(2471, 3883) & = \gcd(2471, 3883-2471)\\
& = \gcd(2471,1412) = \gcd(2471-1412, 1412)\\
& = \gcd(1059,1412) = \gcd(1059,1412-1059)\\
& = \gcd(1059, 353) = 353.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
