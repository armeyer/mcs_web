\begin{problem}
  Let $p$ be the string $\lefbrk\rhtbrk$.  A string of
  brackets is said to be \emph{erasable} iff it can be reduced to
  the empty string by repeatedly erasing occurrences of $p$.  For
  example, to erase the string
\[
\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk\rhtbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk\rhtbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk,
\]
start by erasing the three occurrences of $p$ to obtain
\[
\lefbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk\rhtbrk.
\]
Then erase the single occurrence of $p$ to obtain,
\[\lefbrk\rhtbrk,\]
which can now be erased to obtain the empty string $\emptystring$.

On the other hand the string
\begin{equation}\label{lrrlllll}
\lefbrk\rhtbrk\rhtbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk\rhtbrk
\end{equation}
is not erasable, because when we try to erase, we get stuck.  Namely,
start by erasing the two occurrences of $p$ in~\eqref{lrrlllll} to obtain
\[
\rhtbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\rhtbrk.
\]
The erase the one remaining occurrence of $p$ to obtain.
\[
\rhtbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk\lefbrk.
\]
At this point we are stuck with no remaining occurrences of $p$.
\footnote{Notice that there are many ways to erase a string, depending
  on when and which occurrences of $p$ are chosen to be erased.  It
  turns out that given any initial string, the final string reached
  after performing all possible erasures will be the same, no matter
  how erasures are performed.  We take this for granted here, although
  it is not altogether obvious.  The same issue comes up in the Mating
  Ritual of Section~\bref{mating_ritual_sec}, where a proof is
  provided in a Problem\iffalse by Problem~\ref{TBA}\fi.}

Let $\ES$ be the set of erasable strings of brackets.  Let $\RM$ be
the recursive data type of strings of \emph{matched} brackets \inbook{given in
Definition~\bref{RM-def}}\inhandout{defined recursively:
\begin{itemize}

\item \inductioncase{Base case}: $\emptystring \in\RM$.

\item \inductioncase{Constructor case}: If $s,t \in\RM$, then
$\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t \in \RM$.
\end{itemize}}

% (The definition of $\RM$ is repeated in the Appendix.)

\bparts

\ppart\label{RMsubES} Use structural induction to prove that
\[
\RM \subseteq \ES.
\]

\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
We prove by structural induction on the definition of $\RM$ that
  the predicate
\[
P(x) \eqdef x \in \ES
\]
is true for all $x \in \RM$.

\textbf{Base case} ($x = \emptystring$): The empty string is erasable by
definition of $\ES$---it can be reduced to itself by erasing the
substring $p$ zero times.

\textbf{Constructor case} ($x = \lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t$ for $s,t \in \RM$):  By
structural induction hypothesis, we may assume that $s,t \in \ES$.  So to
erase $x$, erase $s$ and then erase $t$ to be left with the substring
$\lefbrk\rhtbrk$, and one more erasure leads to the empty string.

This completes the proof by structural induction, so we conclude that
\[
\forall x.\ x\in \RM\ \QIMPLIES\ x \in \ES
\]
which by definition means that $\RM \subseteq \ES$.

\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{RMES} Supply the missing parts (labeled by ``(*)'') of the following proof that
\[
\ES \subseteq \RM.
\]

\begin{proof}
We prove by strong induction that every length $n$ string in \ES\ is
also in \RM.  The induction hypothesis is
\[
P(n) \eqdef \forall x \in \ES.\, \lnth{x} = n \QIMPLIES x \in \RM.
\]

\textbf{Base case}:

(*) What is the base case?  Prove that $P$ is true in this case.

\begin{solution}
The base case is ($n = 0$).  Now $P(0)$ is true because the
  empty string is the only string of length 0, and it is in $\RM$ by the
  base case of Definition~\bref{RM-def} of $\RM$.
\end{solution}

\textbf{Inductive step}: To prove $P(n+1)$, suppose $\lnth{x} = n+1$
and $x \in \ES$.  We need to show that $x \in \RM$.

Let's say that a string $y$ is an \emph{erase} of a string $z$ iff $y$
is the result of erasing a \emph{single} occurrence of $p$ in $z$.

Since $x \in \ES$ and has positive length, there must be an erase, $y
\in \ES$, of $x$.  So $\lnth{y} = n-1 \ge 0$, and since $y \in \ES$,
we may assume by induction hypothesis that $y \in \RM$.

Now we argue by cases:

\textbf{Case} ($y$ is the empty string):

(*) Prove that $x \in \RM$ in this case.

\begin{solution}
In this case $x = p \in \RM$.
\end{solution}

\textbf{Case} ($y = \lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t$ for some strings $s, t \in \RM$):
Now we argue by subcases.
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Subcase}($x=py$):

(*) Prove that $x \in \RM$ in this subcase.

\begin{solution}
The string $x = \lefbrk \emptystring \rhtbrk y$ is the result of
applying the $\RM$ constructor to $\emptystring, y \in \RM$.
\end{solution}

\item \textbf{Subcase} ($x$ is of the form $\lefbrk s'\, \rhtbrk t$ where $s$
  is an erase of $s'$):

  Since $s \in \RM$, it is erasable by part~\eqref{RMES}, which implies
  that $s'\in \ES$.  But $\lnth{s'} < \lnth{x}$, so by induction
  hypothesis, we may assume that $s' \in \RM$.  This shows that $x$ is
  the result of the constructor step of $\RM$, and therefore $x \in \RM$.

\item \textbf{Subcase} ($x$ is of the form $\lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t'$ where $t$ is an
  erase of $t'$):

(*) Prove that $x \in \RM$ in this subcase.

\begin{solution}
The proof is essentially identical to the previous case, with
  $t,t'$ in place of $s,s'$:

  Now $t$ is erasable by part~\eqref{RMES}, so $t'\in \ES$.  But
  $\lnth{t'} < \lnth{x}$, so by induction hypothesis, we may assume that
  $t' \in \RM$.  This proves that $x$ is the result of the constructor
  step of $\RM$ and therefore $x \in \RM$.

\end{solution}

\end{itemize}

(*) Explain why the above cases are sufficient.

\begin{solution}
The cases arise from the possible positions of the occurrence
of $p$ in $x$ that was erased to yield $y = \lefbrk s\, \rhtbrk t$.
Namely, the erased $p$ could have appeared to the left of the initial left
bracket in $y$, to the right of that initial left bracket but before its 
matching right bracket, or after the matching right bracket.
\end{solution}

This completes the proof by strong induction on $n$, so we conclude
that $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \nngint$.  Therefore $x \in \RM$
for every string $x \in \ES$.  That is, $\ES \subseteq \RM$.
Combined with part~\eqref{RMsubES}, we conclude that
\[
\ES = \RM.
\]

\end{proof}
