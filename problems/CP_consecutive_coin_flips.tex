\begin{problem}

\bparts

\ppart Suppose we flip a fair coin and let $N_\mathtt{TT}$ be the
number of flips until the first time two Tails in a row appear.  What
is $\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}$?

\hint Let $D$ be the tree diagram for this process.  Explain why
$D$ can be described by the tree in Figure~\ref{tree_D}

\begin{figure}
\graphic{tree_D}
  \caption{Sample space tree for coin toss until two consective heads.}
  \label{tree_D}
\end{figure}

\iffalse

\[
D = H\cdot D + T\cdot(H\cdot D + T).
\]
\fi

Use the \textbf{Law of Total Expectation}%
\inbook{~\bref{total_expect}.}%
\inhandout{: Let $R$~be a random variable and $A_1$, $A_2$, \dots, be
  a partition of the sample space.  Then
\[
    \expect{R} = \sum_i \expcond{R}{A_i} \prob{A_i}.
\]
}

\begin{staffnotes}
Let people struggle a little with the hint, then suggest that $H$
refers to flipping a Head and $T$ to flipping a Tail.  They should be
able to realize that ``$+$'' describes a tree branch.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}=6.
\]

Let $H$ be the event that a Head appears on the first flip, $TH$ the
event that the first flips are Tail then Head, and likewise $TT$.
From $D$ and Total Expectation:

\begin{align*}
\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}
    & = \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{H}    \cdot \pr{H}
       + \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{TH}  \cdot \pr{TH}
       + \expcond{N_\mathtt{TT}}{TT}  \cdot \pr{TT}\\ 
  & = \paren{1 + \expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}\cdot \frac{1}{2} +
      \paren{2 + \expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}\cdot \frac{1}{4} +
       2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\\
  & = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{2}
       + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{4}
       + \frac{1}{2}\\
  & = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{4}
\end{align*}
So
\[
\frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TT}}}{4} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]
\end{solution}


\ppart Suppose we flip a fair coin until a Tail immediately followed
by a Head come up.  What is the expectation of the number
$N_\mathtt{TH}$ of flips we perform?

\begin{solution}
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TH}}=4.
\]

This time the tree diagram is $C \eqdef H\cdot C +T\cdot B$ where the subtree
$B \eqdef H + T\cdot B$.

So
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TH}} =  \paren{1+ \expect{N_\mathtt{TH}}} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
+  (1+ \expect{N_B}) \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]
where $N_B$ is the expected number of flips in the $B$ subtree.  But
\[
\expect{N_B} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (1+\expect{N_B}) \cdot  \frac{1}{2}.
\]
That is, $\expect{N_B} = 2$.  Hence,
\[
\expect{N_\mathtt{TH}} = \frac{1}{2} +\frac{\expect{N_\mathtt{TH}}}{2}
+ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2}
\]
which implies $\expect{N_\mathtt{TH}} = 4$.
\end{solution}

\ppart Suppose we now play a game: flip a fair coin until either
\texttt{TT} or \texttt{TH} first occurs.  You win if \texttt{TT} comes up
first, lose if \texttt{TH} comes up first.  Since \texttt{TT} takes 50\%
longer on average to turn up, your opponent agrees that he has the
advantage.  So you tell him you're willing to play if you pay him \$5 when
he wins, but he merely pays you a 20\% premium, that is, \$6, when you win.

If you do this, you're sneakily taking advantage of your opponent's
untrained intuition, since you've gotten him to agree to unfair odds.
What is your expected profit per game?

\begin{staffnotes}
After the problem is solved, start a discussion of the apparent
paradox: \texttt{TT} and \texttt{TH} are equally likely to show up
first, but \texttt{TT} takes longer to show up on average.
\end{staffnotes}

\begin{solution}
It's easy to see that both \texttt{TT} and \texttt{TH} are
  equally likely to show up first.  (Every game play consists of a
  sequence of \texttt{H}'s followed by a \texttt{T}, after which the game
  ends with a \texttt{T} or an \texttt{H}, with equal probability.)  So
  your expected profit is
\[
\frac{1}{2}\cdot 6 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot (-5)
\]
dollars, that is 50 cents per game.  So leap to play.

It may seem paradoxical \texttt{TT} and \texttt{TH} are equally likely
to show up first, but \texttt{TT} takes longer to show up on average.
The explanation is that \texttt{TT} takes longer to show up after
\texttt{TH} has appeared, than \texttt{TH} takes after \texttt{TT} has
appeared.  This is because when \texttt{TT} appears, we're already one
step along the way to having \texttt{TH} appear afterward, while when
\texttt{TH} shows up first, we start waiting for \texttt{TT} to appear
without a head start.

\end{solution}
