\begin{problem}

%% type: short-answer
%% title: GCD's II

Consider the following two numbers: 
\begin{align*}
    x & = 17^{88} * 31^{5} * 37^{2} * 59^{1000}  \\
    y & = 19^{(9^{22})} * 37^{12} * 53^{3678} * 59^{29}.
\end{align*}

%Please give the prime factorization of your answer as a set of
%(\emph{prime exponent}) pairs.  For example, to write  
%the number $60 = 2^{2} * 3 * 5$, you can write
%\begin{equation*}
%(3 1) (2 2) (5 1)
%\end{equation*}
\bparts
\ppart\label{gcd2:pp1}
Compute their GCD.

\begin{solution}

$37^{2}*59^{29}$.


To get the GCD of two numbers: iterate over all primes that appear in
both factorizations; raise each of them to the \emph{smallest} of its
two exponents; then multiply the resulting powers.

\end{solution}

\ppart
Compute their LCM (least common multiple: $lcm(a,b):=$ the smallest number that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$).

\begin{solution}
$17^{88} * 31^{5} * 37^{12} * 59^{1000}*19^{(9^{22})}* 53^{3678}$.

Replace \emph{smallest} with \emph{greatest} in the procedure for part \ref{gcd2:pp1}.
\end{solution}
