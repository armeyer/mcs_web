\begin{problem}
Some students from a large class will be lined up left to right.
Translate each of the following assertions into predicate formulas
with the set of students in the class as the domain of discourse.  The
only predicates you may use are
\begin{itemize}
\item equality and,
\item $F(x,y)$, meaning that ``$x$ is somewhere to the left of $y$ in the line.''
For example, in the line ``CDA'', both $F(C,A)$ and $F(C,D)$ are true.
\end{itemize}
Once you have defined a formula for a predicate $P$ you may use the
abbreviation ``$P$'' in further formulas.

\bparts

\ppart Student $x$ is in the line.

\begin{center}
\exambox{3in}{0.5in}{0.3in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
  \[\text{inline}(x) \eqdef \exists y.\, F(y,x) \QOR F(x,y) \]
\end{solution}

\ppart
Student $x$ is first in line.

\begin{center}
\exambox{3in}{0.5in}{0.3in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
\[\text{first}(x) \eqdef \text{inline}(x) \QAND \forall y.\, \QNOT F(y,x) \]
\end{solution}

\ppart
Student $x$ is immediately to the right of student $y$.

\begin{center}
\exambox{3in}{0.5in}{0.3in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
  \[\text{isnext}(x,y) \eqdef F(y,x) \QAND \forall z.\, \QNOT(F(y,z) \QAND F(z,x))
  \]
\end{solution}

\ppart
Student $x$ is second.

\begin{center}
\exambox{3in}{0.5in}{0.3in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
  \[
 \exists y. \text{first}(y) \QAND \text{isnext}(x,y)
 \]
\end{solution}
