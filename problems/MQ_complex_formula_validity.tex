\begin{problem}
There are many ways to show that the following formula is valid.
\[\begin{array}{c}
[(\bar{A} \QOR \bar{B} \QOR \bar{C} \QOR \bar{E} \QOR \bar{F})
         \QAND \bar{F}] \QOR G \QOR (\bar{H} \QAND \bar{I} \QAND \bar{J}) \QOR K \\
 \QIMPLIES \\
 \QNOT(\bar{X} \QAND \bar{Y} \QAND \QNOT(X \QIMPLIES Z))
\end{array}\]

\ppart Laborious Lucy decides to verify this formula by truth table.
Write a simple numerical expression for the number of rows she will
have in her truth table.  (You need not evaluate your expression.)

\begin{center}
\exambox{1.0in}{0.6in}{-0.1in}
\end{center}

\begin{solution}
Since there are $14$ variables, there are $2^{14} =  16384$ rows.
\end{solution}

\ppart You decide to be a little more efficient.  Verify that the
formula is valid by reasoning by cases according to the value of $X$.

\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
If $X$ is \True, then $\bar{X}$ is \False, so the right hand side of
the main implication is \True.  If $X$ is \False, then $X \QIMPLIES Z$
is \True, so $\QNOT(X \QIMPLIES Z)$ is \False, so the right hand side
of the main implication again is \True.  So in any case, right hand
side is \True, and so the whole \QIMP-statement is \True.
\end{solution}
