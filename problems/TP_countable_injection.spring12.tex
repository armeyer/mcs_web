\ppart
Prove that if there is a total injective ($[\geq 1 \text{ out}, \leq 1
  \text{ in}]$) relation from $S$ to $\naturals$, then $S$ is
countable.

\begin{solution}
We know there is a total injective relation $S \to \naturals$ iff
there is a surjective function ($[\leq 1 \text{ out}, \geq 1
  \text{ in}]$) from $\naturals \to S$ by
Problem~\bref{TP_inverse_relation_table}, which implies that $S$ is
countable by Problem~\bref{CP_countable_surjection}.

Alternatively, we can prove this directly by reasoning about arrows \TBA{\dots}.
\end{solution}

\ppart\label{S_to_nats}
Assuming $S$ is countably infinite,
prove that the set of functions $S \to \naturals$ is uncountable.

\end{solution}

\ppart \textbf{Alternative to part}~\eqref{S_to_nats}: Let $S$ be a
set with exactly one element.  Prove that the set of relations from
$S$ to $\naturals$ is uncountable.
