\begin{problem}[points = 6, title= \textbf{Minimum element sets}]
For each of the following sets, describe a subset with no minimum element:
\bparts
\ppart The integers, $\integers$.
\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
The negative integers. Alternatively,  the set $\integers$ itself.
\end{solution}
 
\examspace[0.5in]

\ppart The nonnegative rational numbers, $\rationals^{\geq 0}$.

\examspace[0.5in]

\begin{solution}
The positive rationals, $\rationals^{>0}$.
\end{solution}

\ppart The irrational real numbers $\geq \sqrt{3}$.

\examspace[0.5in]
\begin{solution}
The whole set has a minimum element, namely the irrational numbere
$\sqrt{3}$.  But throwing out this minimum element, we get the set
irrational real numbers $> \sqrt{3}$ which has no minimum element.
This follows because if $a$ is an irrational real number $> \sqrt{3}$,
then there is always another irrational number in any positive length
interval strictly between $a$ and $\sqrt{3}$.
\end{solution}
