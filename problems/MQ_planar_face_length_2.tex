\problempart
Show two planar drawings of a \textbf{single} planar graph, such that one of the drawings corresponds to a planar embedding in which at least one discrete face's length is different 
from the lengths of any of the discrete faces in the embedding associated with the other drawing.
\examspace[4in]
\begin{solution}
The pair of planar drawings below meet the given requirements.  The planar embedding corresponding to Figure~\ref{fig:planar-1-sol} includes the discrete face $abdeca$, which has length 5.  The longest discrete face in the 
planar embedding corresponding to Figure~\ref{fig:planar-2-sol} has length 4.

\end{solution}

\problempart
List the discrete faces in each of these two planar embeddings. 

\begin{solution}
For the particular pair shown in Figures~\ref{fig:planar-1-sol} and~\ref{fig:planar-2-sol}, the embeddings are as follows: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  Figure~\ref{fig:planar-1-sol} & Figure~\ref{fig:planar-2-sol} \\ \hline
  $abca$ & $abca$\\
  $bcdb$ & $bcedb$\\
  $cdec$ & $cdec$ \\
  $abdeca$ & $abdca$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{solution}
