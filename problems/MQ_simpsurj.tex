\begin{problem}
The definition of $A \surj B$ requires that there be a surjective
\emph{function} from $A$ to $B$.  Suppose the function condition was
dropped, so we have a simpler definition $A \simpsurj B$ iff there is
a surjective $[\geq 1\ \text{in}]$ relation from $A$ to $B$.  Explain
which sets $A$, $B$ are related by $\simpsurj$.

\begin{solution}
If $A$ is nonempty, then $A \simpsurj B$ is true for all sets $B$, because there 
is an element $e$ in $A$, and the relation that has arrows from $e$ to every 
element of $B$ has $[\geq 1\ \text{in}]$ and is therefore surjective.

Also $\emptyset \simpsurj B$ is true iff $B = \emptyset$.
\end{solution}
