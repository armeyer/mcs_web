\begin{problem}
Show that the chromatic number of the graph, $G$, below is four.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width = 3in]{chi4}
\caption{Graph $G$ with $\chi(G)=4$.}
\end{figure}

\examspace[3in]

\begin{solution}
Since every two vertices are adjacent, all vertices must have
different colors.  There are four vertices, so $\chi(G)=4$.

Of course $G$ is the complete graph $K_4$, and it was already noted in
Section~\bref{sec:coloring} that $\chi(K_n) = n$.
\end{solution}
