\begin{problem}
\begin{quote}
``Every American has a dream.''
\end{quote}
\vspace{0.1in}

Here are two ways to translate this sentence into logic:

\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\roman{enumi}}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}

\begin{enumerate}%[(i)]
\item\label{EdAahas}
$
\exists d \in \text{dreams}\ \forall a \in \text{American}.\ a \text{ has } d.
$

\item \label{AaEdhas}
$
\forall a \in \text{American}\ \exists d \in \text{dreams}.\ a \text{ has } d.
$
\end{enumerate}

Give an interpretation/example that would justify
translation~\eqref{EdAahas}; likewise for~\eqref{AaEdhas}

\begin{solution}
Formula~\eqref{EdAahas} corresponds to the interpretation that there is
\emph{one} dream shared by every American.  Maybe, for example, every
American has the dream of having a family.

Sentence~\eqref{AaEdhas} corresponds to the interpretation that every
American has a personal dream ---some Americans have the dream of
having a family, others of being rich, and others of being famous
---but there may not be any dream they all have in common.
\end{solution}

\end{problem}
