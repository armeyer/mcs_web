\begin{problem}
This problem asks for a proof of Lemma~\bref{rgb} showing that every
weak partial order can be represented by (is isomorphic to) a collection
of sets partially ordered under set inclusion ($\subseteq$).  Namely,

\begin{lemma*}
Let $\preceq$ be a weak partial order on a set, $A$.  For any element
$a \in A$, let
\begin{align*}
\prinv{a} & \eqdef \set{b \in A \suchthat b \preceq a},\\
\mathcal{L} & \eqdef \set{\prinv{a} \suchthat a \in A}.
\end{align*}
Then the function $\prinv{}:A \to \mathcal{L}$ is an isomorphism from the
$\preceq$ relation on $A$, to the subset relation on $\mathcal{L}$.
\end{lemma*}

\ppart
Prove that the function $\prinv{}:A \to \mathcal{L}$ is a bijection.

\begin{solution}
  By definition, $\prinv{}$ is a surjective function onto $\mathcal{L}$,
  so all we have to do is prove it is an injection.  To prove this,
  suppose $\prinv(a) = \prinv{b}$.  Now since $a \in \prinv(a)$ by
  reflexivity, we also have $a \in \prinv{b}$.  This means $a \preceq b$.
  Likewise, $b \preceq a$.  Hence $a=b$, by antisymmetry.
\end{solution}

\ppart Complete the proof by showing that
\begin{equation}\label{apbiff}
a \preceq b  \qiff  \prinv{a} \subseteq \prinv{b}
\end{equation}
for all $a,b \in A$.

\begin{solution}
  For the left-to-right direction, suppose $a \preceq b$.  To prove that
  $\prinv{a} \subseteq \prinv{b}$, suppose $c \in \prinv{a}$, which means
  that $c \preceq a$.  So by transitivity, $c \preceq b$, which means $c
  \in \prinv{b}$.  Hence every $c \in \prinv{a}$ is also in $\prinv{b}$,
  which proves containment.

  For the right-to-left direction, suppose $\prinv{a} \subseteq
  \prinv{b}$.  But $a \in \prinv{a}$ by reflexivity, so $a \in \prinv{b}$,
  which means that $a \preceq b$.

\begin{editingnotes}
\textcolor{green}{elegant, but harder to follow:}

\begin{align*}
a \preceq b
  & \qiff \forall c \in A.\, c \preceq a \QIMPLIES c \preceq b 
           & \text{(because $a \preceq a$)}\\
  & \qiff \forall c \in A.\, c \in \prinv{a} \QIMPLIES c \in \prinv{b}
           & \text{(def of $\prinv$)}\\
  & \qiff \prinv{a} \subseteq \prinv{b}
\end{align*}
