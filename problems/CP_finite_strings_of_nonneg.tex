\begin{problem}
Show that the set $\string{\naturals}$ of finite sequences of
nonnegative integers is countable.

\begin{solution}
Define the \emph{weight} of a finite string of nonnegative integers to
be the larger of the length of the string and the largest integer in
the string.  There are only finitely many strings of any given weight,
$n$, so list the strings in order of weight ordered in some arbitrary
way, say in ``dictionary'' order.
\end{solution}
