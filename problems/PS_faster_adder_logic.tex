\begin{problem}
  As in Problem~\bref{CP_binary_adder_logic}, a digital circuit is
  called an $(n+1)$-bit \emph{half-adder} when it has with $n+2$
  inputs
  \[
  a_n,\dots, a_1, a_0,b
  \]
and $n+2$ outputs
\[
c, s_n, \dots, s_1, s_0.
\]

The input-output specification of the half-adder is that, if the 0-1
values of inputs $a_n,\dots, a_1, a_0$ are taken to be the $(n+1)$-bit
binary representation of an integer, $k$, then the 0-1 values of the
outputs $c, s_n, \dots, s_1, s_0$ are supposed to be the $(n+2)$-bit
binary representation of $k+b$.

For example suppose $n=2$ and the values of $a_2a_1a_0$ were
$\STR{101}$.  This is the binary representation of $k = 5$.  Now if
the value of $b$ was $\mtt{1}$, then the output should be the 4-bit
representation of $5+1=6$.  Namely, the values of $cs_2s_1s_0$ would
be $\STR{0110}$.

There are many different circuit designs for half adders.  The most
straighforward one is the ``ripple carry'' design described in
Problem~\bref{CP_binary_adder_logic}.  We will now develop a different
design for a half-adder circuit called a \emph{parallel-design} or
``look-ahead carry'' half-adder.  This design works by computing the
values of higher-order digits for both a carry of 0 and a carry of 1,
\emph{in parallel}.  Then, when the carry from the low-order digits
finally arrives, the pre-computed answer can be quickly selected.

We'll illustrate this idea by working out a parallel design for an
$(n+1)$-bit half-adder.

Parallel-design half-adders are built out of parallel-design circuits
called \emph{add1}-modules.  The input-output behavior of an
add1-module is just a special case of a half-adder, where instead of
an adding an input $b$ to the input, the add1-module \emph{always}
adds 1.  That is, an $(n+1)$-bit add1-module has $(n+1)$ binary inputs
\[
a_n, \dots, a_1, a_0,
\]
and $n+2$ binary outputs
\[
c\,p_n,\dots, p_1,p_0.
\]
If $a_n \dots a_1 a_0$ are taken to be the $(n+1)$-bit representation of
an integer, $k$, then $cp_n\dots p_1p_0$ is supposed to be the
$(n+2)$-bit binary representation of $k+1$.

So a 1-bit add1-module just has input $a_0$ and outputs $c,p_0$ where
  \begin{align*}
    p_0 & \eqdef a_0\ \QXOR\ 1, (\text{or more simply, } p_0 \eqdef \QNOT(a_0)),\\
    c & \eqdef a_0.
  \end{align*}

In the ripple-carry design, a double-size half-adder with $2(n+1)$
inputs takes twice as long to produce its output values as an
$(n+1)$-input ripple-carry circuit.  With parallel-design
add1-modules, a double-size add1-module produces its output values
nearly as fast as a single-size add1-modules.  To see how this works,
suppose the inputs of the double-size module are
\[
a_{2n+1},\dots, a_1, a_0
\]

and the outputs are
\[
c, p_{2n+1}, \dots, p_1, p_0.
\]
We will build the double-size add1-module by having two single-size
add1-modules work in parallel.  The setup is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:add1}.

Namely, the first single-size add1-module handles the first $n+1$
inputs.  The inputs to this module are the low-order $n+1$ input bits
$a_n,\dots, a_1, a_0$, and its outputs will serve as the first $n+1$
outputs $p_n, \dots, p_1, p_0$ of the double-size module.  Let
$c_{(1)}$ be the remaining carry output from this module.

The inputs to the second single-size module are the higher-order $n+1$
input bits $a_{2n+1}, \dots, a_{n+2}, a_{n+1}$.  Call its first $n+1$
outputs $r_n, \dots, r_1, r_0$ and let $c_{(2)}$ be its carry.

\bparts

\ppart Write a formula for the carry, $c$, of the double-size
add1-module \emph{solely} in terms of carries $c_{(1)}$ and $c_{(2)}$
of the single-size add1-modules.

\begin{solution}
\[
c = c_{(1)}\ \QAND\ c_{(2)}.
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Complete the specification of the double-size add1-module by
writing propositional formulas for the remaining outputs, $p_{n+i}$,
for $1 \leq i \leq n+1$.  The formula for $p_{n+i}$ should only
involve the variables $a_{n+i}$, $r_{i-1}$, and $c_{(1)}$.

\begin{solution}
  The $n+1$ high-order outputs of the double-size module are the
  same as the inputs if there is no carry from the low-order $n+1$
  outputs, and otherwise is the same as the outputs of the second
  single-size \emph{add1} module.  So
\begin{equation}\label{parallel-pi}
p_{n+i} \eqdef (\QNOT(c_{(1)})\ \QAND\ a_{n+i})\ \QOR\ (c_{(1)}\ \QAND\ r_{i-1}).
\end{equation}
for $1 \leq i \leq n+1$.
\end{solution}

  \ppart Explain how to build an $(n+1)$-bit parallel-design
  half-adder from an $(n+1)$-bit add1-module by writing a
  propositional formula for the half-adder output, $s_i$, using only
  the variables $a_i$, $p_i$, and $b$.

\begin{solution}
\[
s_i  \eqdef (b\ \QAND\ p_i)\ \QOR\ (\QNOT(b)\ \QAND\ a_i)
\]
\end{solution}

\ppart Parallel half-adders are exponentially faster than ripple-carry
half-adders.  Confirm this by determining the largest number of
propositional operations required to compute any one output bit of an
$n$-bit add1-module.  (You may assume $n$ is a power of 2.)

\begin{solution}
The most operations for an output are those specified in
formula~\eqref{parallel-pi}.  So it takes at most 4 additional
operations to get any one double-size output bit from the single-size
output bits that it depends on.  It takes $\log_2 n$ doublings to get
from 1-bit to $n$-bit modules, so the largest number of operations
needed for any one output bit is $4 \log_2 n$.

This observation also shows that the \emph{total} number of operations
used in the parallel adder to calculate \emph{all} the output digits
is proportional to $ n \log_2 n$.  This is larger than the total for a
ripple-carry adder by a factor proportional to $\log_2 n$.  So we get
an exponential speed-up (from proportional $n$ to $\log n$) if we
increase the size of the circuit by a factor which grows very slowly
with $n$ (proportional to $\log_2 n$).
\end{solution}
